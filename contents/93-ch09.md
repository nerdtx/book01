## Section 3: Array Operations

Arrays are incredibly flexible in JavaScript. Once you’ve created an array, you
can **add**, **remove**, and **inspect** its contents using a variety of
built-in tools.

### Getting the Length of an Array

Use `.length` to find the number of items in an array.

```js
let cities = ["Austin", "Dallas", "Houston"];
console.log(cities.length); // 3
```

This is helpful for loops and checks.

### Adding to an Array: `.push()`

Use `.push()` to add an item to the *end* of an array:

```js
cities.push("San Antonio");
console.log(cities); // ["Austin", "Dallas", "Houston", "San Antonio"]
```

### Removing the Last Item: `.pop()`

Use `.pop()` to **remove and return** the last item:

```js
let lastCity = cities.pop();
console.log(lastCity); // "San Antonio"
console.log(cities);   // ["Austin", "Dallas", "Houston"]
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> `.push()` and `.pop()` always work on the **end** of the array.

### Inserting or Removing with `.splice()`

The `.splice()` method allows for more control — you can add or remove items at
**any position**.

**Remove 1 item at index 1:**

```js
cities.splice(1, 1);
console.log(cities); // ["Austin", "Houston"]
```


**Insert a new item at index 1:**

```js
cities.splice(1, 0, "Fort Worth");
console.log(cities); // ["Austin", "Fort Worth", "Houston"]
```

Notice, the `cities` array has been altered in both cases.

### Copying and Slicing with `.slice()`

`.slice()` lets you make a **copy** of part of an array without changing the
original.

```js
let someCities = cities.slice(0, 2);
console.log(someCities); // ["Austin", "Fort Worth"]
```

### Checking for an Item: `.includes()`

You can check if an array contains a value:

```js
console.log(cities.includes("Houston")); // true
```

### Summary Table

| Method        | Purpose                    |
| ------------- | -------------------------- |
| `.push()`     | Add to end                 |
| `.pop()`      | Remove from end            |
| `.splice()`   | Add/remove at any position |
| `.slice()`    | Copy part of an array      |
| `.includes()` | Check for a value          |
| `.length`     | Get total number of items  |


These methods give you full control over the contents of an array and will be
essential as you build interactive programs.
