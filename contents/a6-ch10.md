## Section 6: Hands-On Practice – Writing and Using Functions

You’ve now learned how to define functions, call them, return values, and even
chain them together. This section will give you practical experience writing and
using your own JavaScript functions.

### Assignment: Personal Info Formatter

You will write a small program that uses multiple functions to ask for user
input and return personalized messages. The focus is on practicing function
declarations, return values, parameters, and chaining.

#### Your task:

1. **Prompt the user** for their:

   * First name
   * Last name
   * Birth year
   * Favorite color

2. **Write functions** for the following:

   * A function to format the full name from first and last name
   * A function to calculate the user's approximate age (assume current year is
     2025)
   * A function to generate a greeting that includes the full name, age, and
     favorite color
   * A function that logs the greeting to the console

#### Example Output:

```
Hi, John Smith! You are about 16 years old and your favorite color is blue.
```

### Starter Code (with hints):

```js
function getFullName(first, last) {
  // combine first and last name
}

function getAge(birthYear) {
  // subtract birth year from 2025
}

function createGreeting(name, age, color) {
  // return a string with name, age, and color
}

// Prompt the user for inputs using prompt()
let first = prompt("What is your first name?");
let last = prompt("What is your last name?");
let year = prompt("What year were you born?");
let color = prompt("What is your favorite color?");

// Use your functions here
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Remember that `prompt()` returns a string. If you’re doing math (like with the
> birth year), use `parseInt()` to convert it into a number first.
