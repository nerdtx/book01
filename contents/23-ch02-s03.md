## Section 3: IP Addresses and Routing

Every device on the internet needs a unique way to identify itself. Just like
your home has a mailing address, your phone, computer, or server has an **IP
address**. These addresses allow data to travel from one machine to
another - across your neighborhood or across the planet.

### What Is an IP Address?

**IP** stands for **Internet Protocol** - a set of rules for how devices
communicate over networks. An **IP address** is a unique number assigned to
every device that connects to the internet.

Here’s what a typical IP address looks like:

```
192.168.1.42
```

Each part is a number between 0 and 255, separated by dots. This format is
called **IPv4** (Internet Protocol version 4). It’s the most widely used, though
a newer version, **IPv6**, is slowly taking over to handle the growing number of
internet-connected devices.

### Public vs. Private IP Addresses

* **Public IPs** are visible to the wider internet. These are assigned to your
  home router by your internet provider.
* **Private IPs** are used inside local networks. Devices like laptops or phones
  usually get a private IP like `192.168.1.20`.

Your router acts as a middleman, using a method called **NAT** (Network Address
Translation) to connect multiple private devices to the public internet using a
shared public IP.

### How Does Data Know Where to Go?

When you request a webpage, that request is turned into **packets** - small
units of data. Each packet is labeled with:

* The **source IP** (your computer)
* The **destination IP** (the server you want to talk to)

These packets travel across the internet like letters through a postal system.
They pass through many devices along the way—called **routers** - that help
guide the packet toward its destination.

This process of guiding packets is called **routing**.

### The Internet Is Not a Straight Line

Data on the internet doesn’t travel in a direct, predictable path. It takes the
route that is currently available and fastest based on traffic conditions,
server loads, or physical distance.

You can actually see the route a packet takes using a command like `traceroute`
(or `tracert` on Windows), which lists every router it touches along the way.
