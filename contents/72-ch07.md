## Section 2: Embedding JavaScript in an HTML Page

Now that you understand what JavaScript is and why it matters, it’s time to
learn how to actually use it.

There are three common ways to include JavaScript in a web page:

1. Inline JavaScript
2. Internal JavaScript
3. External JavaScript

Let’s break each one down.

### Inline JavaScript (Not Recommended)

You can insert JavaScript directly into an HTML element using the `onclick`
attribute or others like `onmouseover`. While this works, it clutters your HTML
and is hard to maintain.

```html
<button onclick="alert('Hello!')">Click Me</button>
```

This might be okay for a quick test, but you should avoid it in real projects.

### Internal JavaScript (Using `<script>` Tags)

The most common and beginner-friendly way to write JavaScript is to place it
*inside a `<script>` tag* within your HTML file. This tells the browser to
treat the contents as JavaScript.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>My First JavaScript</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Check the Console!</h1>

  <script>
    console.log("JavaScript is running!");
  </script>
</body>
</html>
```

When this page is loaded, the browser finds the `<script>` tag and runs the
JavaScript inside it. The message appears in the **Console** tab of your
browser’s developer tools. The console is a location for system type messages,
such as runtime information or debugging.  The console is never meant for end
users, but as a developer tool.

### External JavaScript Files

As your code grows, it’s best to keep JavaScript in its *own file*, just like
CSS. This makes it easier to read, reuse, and debug.

1. Create a file called `script.js`
2. Put your JavaScript code inside.  Maybe something like:

```js
console.log("Hello from an external file!");
```

3. Then link to it in your HTML using the `src` attribute on a `<script>` tag:

```html
<script src="script.js"></script>
```

### Where Should You Put the `<script>` Tag?

There are two common places to include a `<script>` tag:

* In the `<head>` section: runs early, but might run before the page is fully
  built
* At the end of the `<body>` section: runs after all HTML is loaded (this is
  typically better for beginners)

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Always check the Console tab in your browser’s developer tools to see the
> output of your `console.log()` messages or to look for errors.
