# Preface

Whew.  How do you distill highly technical things down into something that isn't
overwhelming?

I'm still not sure.

But, this book is an effort to do just that.  To make the whole realm of
software development accessible, and possibly even fun while opening up a whole
new way of seeing the world.

You are the guinea pigs. This is the first class taught with this book.

Please, be open!  Share your thoughts. What works? What doesn't? What could get
a little better?

Thanks for going on this journey with me.
