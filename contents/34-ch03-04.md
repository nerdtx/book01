## Section 4: Common Tags and Their Purpose

Now that you understand how HTML is structured, it’s time to get familiar with
the most commonly used tags. These are the building blocks of almost every web
page.

Each tag serves a specific purpose - some organize content, others display
media, and some add functionality. Learning these early will make the rest of
your web development journey much smoother.

### Headings: `<h1>` to `<h6>`

Headings define titles and subtitles.

```html
<h1>Main Title</h1>
<h2>Section Title</h2>
<h3>Subsection</h3>
```

- Use `<h1>` for the main heading. Typically one per page.
- Lower-level headings (like `<h3>`, `<h4>`) represent deeper nesting in your
content.

The smaller the number (`h1`), typically the bigger the text used to display
that heading. Likewise, the bigger the number (`h3`), the smaller the text used
to display that heading.  Think of it as first place through sixth place.

### Paragraphs: `<p>`

The `<p>` tag wraps blocks of text into readable paragraphs.

```html
<p>This is a chunk of text that appears as a single block on the page.</p>
```

### Line Breaks: `<br>`

For short, manual line breaks inside a paragraph, use `<br>`. Avoid overusing
it for layout, let the rendering engine do it's job.

```html
<p>Line one<br>Line two</p>
```

Would look like:

> Line one `\\`{=latex}
> Line two


### Emphasis and Strong: `<em>` and `<strong>`

These tags are used to highlight text.

```html
<em>This text is emphasized (usually italic).</em>
<strong>This text is strong (usually bold).</strong>
```

They have **semantic meaning** - screen readers and search engines treat them as
important. Semantic is a word that means "providing meaning within a language".
A semantically important tag will convey some extra meaning to the browser.
For instance, for a blind individual using a braille reader, that braille
renderer will treat that text differently because of a semantically relevant
tag.


### Lists: `<ul>`, `<ol>`, and `<li>`

Lists are made up of list items:

- `<ul>` is an **unordered list** (bullets)
- `<ol>` is an **ordered list** (numbers)
- `<li>` is a **list item**

Example:

```html
<ul>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>JavaScript</li>
</ul>
```

Would render something like:

> • HTML `\\`{=latex}
> • CSS `\\`{=latex}
> • Javascript


### Links: `<a>`

The `<a>` tag creates hyperlinks.

```html
<a href="https://nerdtx.dev">Visit NerdTX</a>
```

- The `href` attribute holds the destination and can be thought of as hypertext
  reference.
- Links can point to other websites, other pages in your project, or specific
  places within the same page.


### Images: `<img>`

The `<img>` tag displays images.

```html
<img src="logo.png" alt="NerdTX Logo">
```

- `src` points to the image file.
- `alt` provides a text description for accessibility and for when images can’t
  be loaded.


### Comments: `<!-- blah blah blah -->`

Sometimes it is helpful to be able to add a comment to the code of an HTML
document and it not get displayed by the browser.

The `<!-- comments -->` tag is perfect for this.

Anything between the opening `<!--` and the closing `-->` tags will be hidden.

Example:

```html
<p>
  This is <b> very cool </b>
  <!-- and this is invisible to the user -->
</p>
```

| `<h1>`  | Main heading                     |
| `<p>`   | Paragraph of text                |
| `<br>`  | Line break                       |
| `<em>`  | Emphasized (italic) text         |
| `<strong>` | Strong (bold) text           |
| `<ul>`  | Unordered list                   |
| `<ol>`  | Ordered list                     |
| `<li>`  | List item                        |
| `<a>`   | Hyperlink                        |
| `<img>` | Image display                    |
| `<!-- comments -->` | Comments to hide   |


> **Helpful Hint:**
> Tags aren't just about looks - they give meaning to your content. A screen
> reader for the blind doesn’t care about font size, but it does care whether
> something is a heading or just bold text.  Semantic tags aren't just for
> those with disabilities.  Smart phones and other devices use them as hints
> for rendering content on various screens other than a traditional desktop.
