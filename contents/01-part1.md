# Part 1 - How Computers ...

In this area of the book, we're going to briefly dive into the way that
computers function.

We won't spend too much time here, but it will be enough to give you an idea, as
a journeyman, of the platform upon which you'll be creating and working.

Knowing a bit about the way computers work and talk to each other on the modern
internet is key to being able to think in ways that take advantage of these
wonderful tools.  They're more than just a way to watch cat videos or get that
epic snipe in some FPS game.

Some parts will get a bit difficult technically. Just speak up, ask questions.
This is fun stuff!
