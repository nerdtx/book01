## Section 2: Ways to Apply CSS

CSS can be connected to your HTML in more than one way. In this section, you'll
learn the three most common methods of applying CSS:

1. Inline styles
2. Internal styles (inside a `<style>` tag)
3. External stylesheets (in a separate file)

Each approach has its uses - and its limitations.

### Inline Styles

Inline styles are written directly inside an HTML element using the `style`
attribute.

```html
<p style="color: red;">This text is red.</p>
```

This method is easy to understand and quick to try - but it clutters your HTML
and doesn't scale well.

Use only for quick tests or very specific overrides.

### 2. Internal Styles

Internal styles go inside a `<style>` tag, which is placed inside the `<head>`
of your HTML document. This keeps your styling separate from your content but
still in the same file.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <style>
      p {
        color: blue;
      }
    </style>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>This text is blue.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Internal styles are useful for small projects or pages with unique designs.
You’ll use this method often in early exercises.

### External Stylesheets

An external stylesheet is a separate `.css` file that contains only style rules.
You link it to your HTML using a `<link>` tag in the `<head>`:

```html
<!-- In your HTML file -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
```

```css
/* In your styles.css file */
p {
  color: green;
}
```

This is the most powerful and maintainable way to apply styles - especially for
large or multi-page projects.

### Choosing the Right Method

| Method   | Best For                          | Notes               |
| -------- | --------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Inline   | Quick tests or overrides          | Avoid in production |
| Internal | Single-page styling or prototypes | Good for learning   |
| External | Large projects or shared styles   | Best practice       |

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Internal styles help you learn CSS in a controlled environment. Once you’re
> comfortable, moving your styles to external stylesheets will keep your
> projects cleaner and more organized.

them to the right parts of your HTML.
