## Section 5: The `id` and `class` Attributes (Preview)

Now that you're grouping your content using `<div>`, it’s time to label those
groups so you can refer to them later—for styling, scripting, or documentation.

In HTML, we use two powerful attributes to do this: `id` and `class`.

These don’t change how the page looks on their own, but they’re essential for
**identifying** and **targeting** parts of your page.

### The `id` Attribute

The `id` attribute gives an element a **unique name**. No two elements on the
same page should have the same `id`.

```html
<div id="header">
  <h1>My Website</h1>
</div>
```

Use `id` when you’re marking something that only appears once on the page—like
a header, footer, or main content area.

You’ll use this label later when:

* Styling with CSS: `#header { background-color: gray; }`
* Targeting in JavaScript: `document.getElementById("header")` (Later!)

### The `class` Attribute

The `class` attribute lets you label a group of elements that share the same
role or appearance.

```html
<div class="article">
  <h2>Article Title</h2>
  <p>This is the content.</p>
</div>

<div class="article">
  <h2>Another Article</h2>
  <p>More content goes here.</p>
</div>
```

Here, both divs are labeled `class="article"`. You can apply styling to all
elements in this class at once or use it in JavaScript to select multiple
things at once.

Unlike `id`, a class name **can** be reused many times on the same page.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use `id` for things that are one-of-a-kind. Use `class` when you have a
> category of elements that might repeat.

### Best Practices for IDs and Classes

* Use clear, meaningful names: `header`, `main-content`, `user-profile`
* Avoid spaces in names; use hyphens or camelCase if needed
* Don't overuse `id` - reserve it for top-level or unique elements
* Keep class names consistent across pages and projects

In the next section, you'll see some practical layout patterns that combine
`<div>`, `id`, and `class` to build reusable and expandable structures.
