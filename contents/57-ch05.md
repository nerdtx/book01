## Section 7: Laying Out Pages with CSS Grid

While using `inline-block` can create simple multi-column layouts, they can
quickly become awkward and difficult to maintain. Modern web design often relies
on **CSS Grid**, a layout system that gives you precise control over rows,
columns, and positioning.

---

### What Is CSS Grid?

CSS Grid is a layout model that allows you to define both rows and columns in a
two-dimensional grid. Imagine something like a tic-tac-toe board. You can then
“place” your page sections into that grid.

Think of it like drawing a table for your layout—except it’s more flexible,
responsive, and designed specifically for web styling.

### Defining a Grid

You start by declaring a container as a grid:

```css
#page {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr 200px;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  gap: 20px;
}
```

This creates:

* **Three columns**: a fixed 200px sidebar, a flexible middle (`1fr` = “one
  fraction”, or use up the available space), and another 200px sidebar
* **Three rows**: one for a header, one for the main content, and one for a
  footer
* A **20px gap** between grid cells

---

### Placing Items in the Grid

Each direct child of the grid container can be positioned using `grid-column`
and `grid-row`.

Example:

```css
#header {
  grid-column: 1 / 4;   /* Span all 3 columns */
  grid-row: 1;          /* First row */
}

#content {
  grid-column: 2;       /* Middle column */
  grid-row: 2;          /* Second row */
}

#sidebar {
  grid-column: 1;       /* Left column */
  grid-row: 2;          /* Second row */
}

#footer {
  grid-column: 1 / 4;   /* Span all 3 columns */
  grid-row: 3;          /* Third row */
}
```

With just a few rules, you’ve built a three-row, three-column page with a
header, sidebar, content area, and footer.

In your document, you would create divs that have these ids and they will be
placed in the appropriate location of the grid, as we'll see below.

### Example: Basic Page Layout with Grid

```html
<div id="page">
  <div id="header">Header</div>
  <div id="sidebar">Sidebar</div>
  <div id="content">Main Content</div>
  <div id="footer">Footer</div>
</div>
```

Styled with:

```css
#page {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 200px 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  gap: 10px;
}

#header {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
}

#footer {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
}
```

This creates a clean, responsive layout that adapts much more smoothly than
older techniques.

### Why Use Grid?

* **Clarity**: Layouts are declared directly in CSS, not hacked together with
  floats
* **Flexibility**: Columns and rows can be resized with fractions or percentages
* **Maintainability**: Changing layout is as simple as adjusting the grid
  template

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Think of CSS Grid as the blueprint of your page. Divs are your building
> blocks, but Grid is the plan that tells you exactly where each block should
> go.
