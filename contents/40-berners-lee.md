# Historical Figure - Tim Berners-lee

## The Inventor of the World Wide Web

In the early 1990s, the internet existed—but it was difficult to use. There were
no web pages, no hyperlinks, and no browsers. If you wanted to access
information on a remote server, you had to know specific commands and protocols.

## A Vision for Simplicity

While working at CERN, a physics research center in Switzerland, Tim Berners-Lee
wanted an easier way for scientists to share information. His idea was simple
but revolutionary: create a system of documents that could link to each other
and be accessed by anyone, anywhere.

To make that idea work, he invented three things:

* **HTML** – A markup language for formatting web documents
* **HTTP** – A protocol for sending and receiving those documents
* **URLs** – A system for identifying and locating those documents

This combination became the foundation of the **World Wide Web**.

## The First Web Page

In 1991, Berners-Lee launched the first website:
`http://info.cern.ch`

It explained what the World Wide Web was, how to use it, and even how to create
your own web page. He also created the first web browser/editor, called
**WorldWideWeb** (later renamed Nexus).

At the time, this invention wasn’t seen as a major event—but within a few years,
it transformed global communication.

## A Commitment to Openness

Tim Berners-Lee made a critical decision: he **gave away** the web. He didn’t
patent it, restrict it, or charge people to use it. Instead, he insisted that it
be:

* **Open**
* **Free**
* **Decentralized**

This decision allowed the web to grow rapidly. By the mid-1990s, millions of
people were building web pages using HTML.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Berners-Lee created the tools we’re learning right now. Every time you write
> an HTML page, you’re participating in his vision of a free and open web.
