## Section 4: Domain Names and DNS

Imagine if you had to memorize a 12-digit number to text a friend every time.
That’s what computers do—they use numbers to identify each other. But humans? We
prefer names.

This is where **domain names** come in.

### IPs vs. Names

Every device on the internet has an **IP address**, like:

```
192.168.191.206
```

That might be the address for `google.com` - but which one is easier to
remember?

* `142.250.191.206`
* `google.com`

Domain names are **human-readable labels** that map to numeric IP addresses.
They let you type names like `nerdtx.dev` instead of trying to recall
complicated strings of numbers.

They also allow service providers to move a server around without everyone
having to learn a new number.  `nerdtx.dev` might move to a new server on a new
ip address, but users only need to remember that name.

### What Is DNS?

**DNS** stands for **Domain Name System**. It’s like the **phonebook of the
internet**. When you type a domain name into your browser, DNS is what helps
translate it into the correct IP address behind the scenes.

### How DNS Works (Simplified)

Let’s walk through what happens when you visit a site like `nerdtx.dev`:

1. **You type** `nerdtx.dev` into your browser.
2. Your device checks its **local DNS cache** to see if it already knows the IP.
3. If not, it sends a request to a **DNS resolver** (usually your internet
   provider).
4. The resolver checks with other DNS servers until it finds the IP address.
5. That IP is returned to your browser.
6. Now your browser knows where to send the request.

All of this happens in _milliseconds_, before the actual web page even begins
loading.

### Anatomy of a Domain Name

```
www.example.com
            └── Top-Level Domain (TLD) – `.com`, `.org`, `.dev`, etc.
      └──────── Domain Name – `example`
└────────────── Subdomain – `www` (optional)
```

Together, these parts form a **fully qualified domain name (FQDN)**.

### Common Top-Level Domains (TLDs)

| TLD    | Purpose                      |
| ------ | ---------------------------- |
| `.com` | Commercial websites          |
| `.org` | Nonprofits, organizations    |
| `.net` | Originally for networks      |
| `.edu` | Educational institutions     |
| `.gov` | Government sites (U.S.)      |
| `.dev` | Developer tools or platforms |
