## Assignment – Build a Structured Web Page

### Objective

In this assignment, you’ll create a complete, well-formed HTML page that
demonstrates your understanding of the tags and structural concepts introduced
in this chapter. You’ll combine headings, paragraphs, lists, links, and images
to create a clean, content-rich page.

### Instructions

Create a file named `ch03.html` that includes the required elements and the
instructed content.

#### Required Elements:

1. **Document Structure**

   * Include the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.
   * Use `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` elements appropriately.
   * Include a `<title>` element in the head.

2. **Headings**

   * Use at least **three levels** of headings (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`).
   * Make sure each heading introduces new content below it.

3. **Paragraphs**

   * Write at least **three paragraphs** of content on a topic you care about
     (e.g., a hobby, favorite book, historical event) with 2 sentences each.

4. **List**

   * Add either an **unordered list** or an **ordered list** with at least
     **four items**.

5. **Hyperlink**

   * Include one hyperlink using the `<a>` tag that points to an external site.

6. **Image**

   * Add one image using the `<img>` tag.
   * Use an appropriate `alt` attribute that describes the image meaningfully.

7. **Line Break**

   * Use `<br>` at least once in a way that makes sense (for example, to split
     lines in a quote or address).

8. **Text Emphasis**

   * Use at least one instance of `<strong>` and one of `<em>` somewhere in
     your content.
