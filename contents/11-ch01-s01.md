# Chapter 1: How Computers Think

## Section 1: What Is a Computer, Really?

At its core, a computer is not some magical box. It is a machine—built from
metal, plastic, and electricity - that follows instructions exactly as they are
given. Despite their complexity, computers are not intelligent in the way humans
are. They have no creativity or common sense. What they do have is speed,
consistency, and the ability to remember and process enormous amounts of
information very quickly.

A **computer** is any device that can:

1. Receive input,
2. Process that input using a series of instructions,
3. Store and retrieve data as needed,
4. And produce output.

Whether you're checking the time on your smart watch or driving an autonomous
rover on Mars, these simple principles are true of all computers.

### Hardware vs. Software

Computers are made up of two essential components:

* **Hardware** is the physical machine itself—the screen, the keyboard, the CPU
  (central processing unit), memory chips, etc.
* **Software** is the collection of instructions that tells the hardware what to
  do. This includes operating systems, web browsers, games, and even this
  textbook if you're reading it on-screen.

Software gives meaning to hardware. Without it, your computer is just an
expensive (or cheap) brick.

### Electricity and Binary States

Under the hood, computers work by detecting and manipulating tiny electrical
signals. These signals can be either **on** or **off**. That’s it. Just two
states. These two states are represented by the numbers `1` (on) and `0` (off).
These single units are called **bits** (short for *binary digits*).

All the complexity of computing—from rendering a 3D video game to sending a
rocket to the moon—starts with collections of 1s and 0s.
