## Assignment – Style a Web Page

Now it’s your turn to apply what you’ve learned.

In Chapter 3, you created an HTML page using headings, paragraphs, lists,
images, and links. Your challenge now is to **style that page using CSS**.

This assignment will reinforce your understanding of:

* Selectors (`element`, `id`, and `class`)
* Common properties (`color`, `font-family`, `margin`, `padding`, etc.)
* Internal `<style>` blocks
* Clean and readable CSS

### Assignment: Apply CSS to Your Existing HTML Page

Start with the HTML you built in Chapter 3. Add a `<style>` block in the
`<head>` and write CSS to give your page a custom look.

#### Requirements:

Your CSS must include:

* At least _3 different selectors_
  * One element selector (e.g. `p`)
  * One class selector (e.g. `.card`)
  * One ID selector (e.g. `#main-header`)
* At least _5 different properties_
  * Examples: `color`, `background-color`, `font-size`, `text-align`, `padding`
* Spacing with `margin` and `padding` on at least one element
* Custom fonts using `font-family`
* A consistent, readable color scheme using **hex codes** or **named colors**
* Proper indentation and formatting

#### Optional Challenges:

* Add a subtle border or background color to one section
* Use grouping to style multiple elements at once

### Sample HTML + CSS Starter (for reference only)

```html
<head>
  <style>
    body {
      font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
      background-color: #f9f9f9;
      color: #333333;
      margin: 40px;
    }

    h1 {
      color: #0055a5;
      text-align: center;
    }

    .highlight {
      background-color: #ffffcc;
      padding: 10px;
    }

    #footer {
      margin-top: 30px;
      text-align: center;
      font-size: 12px;
    }
  </style>
</head>
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Your goal isn't to make a flashy design—it's to make sure every part of your
> page is organized, legible, and thoughtfully styled. Don’t overcomplicate it.

Once you complete this assignment, you’ll have a fully structured and styled
page - an impressive early milestone in your journey as a developer.
