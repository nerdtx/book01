## Section 5: The HTTP Protocol

When your browser communicates with a website, it needs a shared language to ask
for information and understand the response. That language is called **HTTP**.

### What Does HTTP Stand For?

**HTTP** means **HyperText Transfer Protocol**. It’s a set of rules that governs
how clients (like your browser) and servers (like `example.com`) talk to each
other over the web.

HTTP is what makes the World Wide Web work. It defines how:

* You can ask for a page (like `/about`) from server
* The server can answer your request
* Ensure that client and server understand what just happened

### HTTP Is a Request–Response Protocol

Every interaction follows this simple model:

1. **Client sends a request**
2. **Server sends a response**

These messages contain important details: the method, the path, and other
instructions or metadata.

### Example Request (Simplified)

Your browser might send:

```
GET /index.html HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
```

And the server might reply:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

<html> ... </html>
```

Let’s break that down:

* `GET`: This is the **method** indicating the type of request. GET means
  “please send me this file.”
* `/index.html`: This is the **path** or the location of the file being
  requested on the server
* `HTTP/1.1`: The **protocol version** being used, indicating which flavor of
  HTTP is this session trying to use.
* `Host`: Specifies the domain being contacted.
* `200 OK`: A **status code** (or protocol specific way to indicate the result
  of the request) that means “success!”
* `Content-Type`: Describes what kind of data is coming back.

### Common HTTP Methods

| Method   | Purpose                    |
| -------- | -------------------------- |
| `GET`    | Request data (most common) |
| `POST`   | Submit data to the server  |
| `PUT`    | Update existing data       |
| `DELETE` | Remove data from server    |

### Common HTTP Status Codes

| Code  | Meaning                      |
| ----- | ---------------------------- |
| `200` | OK (successful request)      |
| `301` | Moved permanently (redirect) |
| `403` | Forbidden                    |
| `404` | Not Found                    |
| `500` | Internal Server Error        |

You’ve probably seen a `404` before - it means the server couldn’t find the file
you asked for.

### Analogy: Asking a Librarian for a Book

HTTP is like walking up to a library desk:

* You ask for a book by title (`GET /book.pdf`)
* The librarian (server) checks their system
* If it’s available, they hand it over (`200 OK`)
* If it’s missing, they shrug (`404 Not Found`)
* If something breaks, they panic behind the desk (`500 Server Error`)
