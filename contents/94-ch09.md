## Section 4: Looping Through Arrays

Now that you’ve learned how to create and modify arrays, let’s look at how to
*loop through them*. This is essential when you want to perform the same
action for *each item* in a list — like printing all the usernames, checking
values, or building HTML.

### Using a `for` Loop

The most common way to iterate through an array is with a `for` loop:

```js
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];

for (let i = 0; i < colors.length; i++) {
  console.log(colors[i]);
}
```

This loop starts at index `0` and keeps running until `i` reaches the length of
the array. The expression `colors[i]` accesses each item in the array.

### The `for...of` Loop

A newer and cleaner way to loop through arrays is the `for...of` loop:

```js
for (let color of colors) {
  console.log(color);
}
```

This does the same thing — but without needing to deal with indexes.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use `for...of` when you don't need the index number. It's shorter and easier
> to read.

### Using `.forEach()`

Arrays also come with a built-in method called `.forEach()` that runs a function
on each item:

```js
function printColor(color) {
  console.log(color);
}
colors.forEach(printColor);
```

Don't worry we'll talk about functions in an upcoming chapter. Put this one in
your pocket for now.

### Summary

| Method       | Good For...                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| `for` loop   | When you need the index or more control |
| `for...of`   | Cleanly looping through values          |
| `.forEach()` | Applying a function to each value       |

Looping is a powerful tool that will let you process arrays, generate output,
and automate repetitive tasks. These patterns will come up again and again as
you write programs.
