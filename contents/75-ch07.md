## Section 5: String Concatenation and Template Literals

In programming, you often need to combine pieces of text (called **strings**)
together to create messages, display results, or form dynamic values. JavaScript
provides a couple of ways to do this: *concatenation* (jamming multiple strings
together) and *template literals*.

### String Concatenation (Using `+`)

The `+` operator allows you to join (or concatenate) strings together.

```js
let firstName = "Ada";
let lastName = "Lovelace";
let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;

console.log(fullName); // Ada Lovelace
```

If you combine a string and a number, JavaScript will convert the number into a
string and combine them:

```js
let age = 17;
console.log("I am " + age + " years old."); // I am 17 years old.
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Be mindful of spaces when concatenating strings. You'll need to include them
> manually, like `" "`, if you want space between words.

### Template Literals (Using Backticks)

A more modern and cleaner way to build strings is by using **template
literals**. These use backticks ( ` ) instead of quotes and allow you to insert
variables directly using `${}`.

```js
let name = "Grace";
let hobby = "mathematics";

console.log(`${name} loves ${hobby}.`); // Grace loves mathematics.
```

You can even use expressions inside the `${}`:

```js
let a = 5;
let b = 3;

console.log(`The sum is ${a + b}.`); // The sum is 8.
```

Template literals also support **multi-line strings**:

```js
let message = `Hello!
This is a message
on multiple lines.`;

console.log(message);
```


### When to Use What

* Use **template literals** when building complex or multi-variable strings.
* Use **concatenation** when doing quick joins of a couple small strings.

Both methods work — but template literals are generally preferred for clarity
and readability.
