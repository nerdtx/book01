## Section 7: More on Links

Every link displays to the user some hint about the desination and tells the
browser where to navigate to if the user interacts with it.

In this section, you'll learn how about the differences on where content can
live and how to reference that content, whether it's on the same server or some
far off server.

### Relative versus Absolute

Let's pause for a moment and consider giving someone directions.

If you are in a parking lot of a shopping center and want to tell someone which
store to go to, you won't start with "first you drive to the city you're already
in, then you drive on this street and turn into the parking lot, then you go to
this store over there" and then you point.

You'd just point.  "That store. The one with the creepy clown holding a bowl of
guacamole. That store." And you point.

That's a **relative reference**.  You are starting from where you are and saying
"relative to this location where we are now, it's just right there."

Now imagine you are standing in Austin, Texas. You're telling a friend about a
a certain train themed restaurant that you just loved that happens to be in
Little Rock, Arkansas.  Would you point to the North vaguely and say "uh go
that way about 10 hours or so.. try the chicken strips"?  You would tell them
the city it's located and maybe even look up the exact address and let them
figure out how to navigate that way.  That street address would be an **absolute
reference**.  It's a distinct address with everything they need to know to be
able to look up the restaurant themselves and find it.

It's the same thing with links and URLs.

Consider...

```html
<a href="store.html">that store</a>
```

And this one...

```html
<a href="https://train.restaurant/table.html">this exact place</a>
```

Notice that the first one, `store.html` does not mention the protocol, or the
domain.  It's just a path component.

The second one, `https://train.restaurant/table.html`, has a protocol, a domain,
and a path. This is an absolute reference.

### More on Relative References

If you are only referencing content on the same domain, in the same folder when
creating a URL reference, then you can use a relative domain without any path
modifier.

If the resource is located in a different folder, there are a couple of options
to reference it.

**from the root**

If the path is well known and **static** (it won't change), the resource can be
references by full path on the same server by prepending a `/` to the beginning
of the path to reference the **root** or start of the folder structure.

#### Example With Paths

Given the following structure (anything with a `/` trailing it is a folder).

```text
/               <-- root folder
  content/      <-- content folder
    imgs/       <-- images folder
      logo.png
    index.html
    second.html
```

The path to the logo image would be `/imgs/logo.png`.

For index.html to reference that in an img, there are three options:

```html
  <img src='imgs/logo.png'>
  <img src='./imgs/logo.png'>
  <img src='/content/imgs/logo.png'>
```

Each of these are subtle but different.

The first one, `imgs/logo.png` says "look in the imgs folder in the same folder
as the current file, and there should be an image there called logo.png".

The second one, `./imgs/logo.png` is a more explicit way of the same thing. The
`./` says "in this exact folder start looking". Then with `./imgs`, it says "in
this exact folder is an imgs folder".  It then looks for the file of the image
in `logo.png`.

The third option, `/content/imgs/logo.png`, says "start at the top, look in the
`content` folder, then the `imgs` folder, and you'll find the logo file.

The third option is an _absolute_ path, but _relative_ to the same server.

Read the last sentence again, I'll wait.  This is an important concept.

### Absolute References

If you wish to reference content that shares no component of the originating or
current file, you must use an absolute reference.

Example:

```html
https://nerdtx.dev/imgs/nerdtx.png
```

This specifies the protocol to use, the domain to use to find the server, the
path to the resource on that server.  This is an absolute reference.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Knowing when to use which type of reference can seem tricky. By default, if
> the content is all together, always use a relative path. This makes it easier
> to move your site around all together and to work on it with it being hosted
> locally instead of having to upload it to a server to view it.
