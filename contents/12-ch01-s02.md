## Section 2: How Instructions Work

A computer, as powerful as it may seem, can only do what it is told. Its entire
operation revolves around executing instructions—one after another, at
remarkable speed.

### What Is an Instruction?

An **instruction** is a single operation a computer knows how to perform.
Instructions are written in a language the computer understands, and each
instruction typically performs one small task: load a number from memory, add
two values, compare two numbers, or move data from one place to another.

Even the most complex software applications—video editing tools, web browsers,
or video games—are nothing more than millions (or billions) of these small
instructions working together in sequence.  Want to change the color of
something on the screen, change a number associated with that screen location.

### Programs Are Recipes

Think of a program like a recipe in a cookbook. Each step is clear and
unambiguous.

**Make her a cake or something**

```text
1. Preheat the oven to 350°F.
2. Mix flour and sugar in a bowl.
3. Add eggs and stir.
4. Pour into a pan.
5. Bake for 30 minutes.
```

In the same way, a computer program might:

```text
1. Load two numbers into memory.
2. Add them together.
3. Display the result on the screen.
```

The difference is that computers don’t skip steps, guess, or improvise. They
execute exactly what the instructions say—nothing more, nothing less.

The **CPU** (Central Processing Unit) of the computer operates on one
instruction (sort of but that's for a different class) at a time.  If those
instructions are out of order, your program can end up in an indeterminate
state - meaning end up in a confused conundrum.  You will often see a crash when
this happens.
