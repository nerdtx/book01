## Assignment 1 – Build a Structured Page Using Divs and Inline-Block

Now that you’ve learned how to structure content using `<div>` elements and
label your sections with `id` and `class`, it’s time to put those ideas into
practice.

Your task is to build a complete, multi-section HTML page that uses divs to
organize content clearly. You will use `display: inline-block`
to style these sections.

### Required Structure:

* A `header` section containing your name and a short page title
* A `main-content` section with:
  * A short paragraph about yourself
  * A list of hobbies or interests
* A `sidebar` section with:
  * A small collection of favorite links or quotes
* A `footer` with contact or placeholder info

### Requirements:

* Use at least **4 `<div>`** elements to create the page’s major regions
* Use **unique `id` attributes** for each main section
* Use at least **one `class` attribute** for something that could be reused (like “card” or “box”)
* Indent your code properly to show nesting
* Use comments in your HTML to mark different regions (optional but encouraged)
* Write the css to cause the main-content and sidebar sections to render as
  columns using `display: inline-block`

### Sample Skeleton (Unstyled):

```html
<div id="header">
  <h1>Your Name</h1>
  <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
</div>

<div id="main-content">
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>Some quick info...</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Interest 1</li>
    <li>Interest 2</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="sidebar">
  <p>Here are some links I like:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="#">Example Link</a></li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div id="footer">
  <p>Contact info here</p>
</div>
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Focus on organizing your content before you worry about making it look good.
> A clean structure is the foundation for everything that comes next.
