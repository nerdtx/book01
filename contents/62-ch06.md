## Section 2: The `<form>` Element

The most important tag when building a form is - unsurprisingly- the `<form>`
tag.  This element wraps around all the other form fields (inputs, buttons,
labels) and tells the browser: *this group of elements belongs together and
should be submitted as a single unit*.

---

### The Role of the `<form>` Tag

The `<form>` element defines a form block. It has two important attributes:

* `action` – where the form data should be sent
* `method` – how the data should be sent (`GET` or `POST`)

Example:

```html
<form action="/submit" method="POST">
  <!-- input fields go here -->
</form>
```

For now, don’t worry too much about what `/submit` or `POST` mean. Later in this
course, when you build pages that talk to APIs, these attributes will become
important. For now, you can leave them empty:

```html
<form>
  <!-- your fields -->
</form>
```

---

### Grouping Inputs Together

All interactive fields should live *inside* the `<form>` tag. This lets the
browser:

* Track what values are entered
* Handle the "submit" button
* Validate inputs
* Package the data together for sending

Example:

```html
<form>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input type="text" name="username">
  </label>
  <input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>
```

If you forget to wrap your inputs in a form, the submit button won’t work
properly, and nothing will be sent anywhere.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Always start your form by writing the opening `<form>` and closing `</form>`
> tags before adding any inputs. This will help you avoid forgetting to wrap
> your fields.

---

### The `name` Attribute

Every input inside a form should have a `name` attribute. This is the key used
to identify the value when the form is submitted.

Example:

```html
<input type="text" name="email">
```

If you leave off `name`, the value of that field won't be included when the form
is submitted.
