# Chapter 3: HTML Basics

## Section 1: What Is HTML?

The web is made of many different parts - servers, addresses, browsers, and
protocols. But at the heart of it all is the code that tells your browser
_what_ to show: that code is called **HTML**.

### What Does HTML Stand For?

**HTML** stands for **HyperText Markup Language**.

* **HyperText** means links that can connect one page to another.
* **Markup** means the tags (or instructions) added to plain text to give it
  structure.
* **Language** means HTML has rules and patterns that must be followed.

HTML is not _really_ a programming language - it doesn’t run logic or control
decision-making. Instead, it describes **structure and content**.

### What Is HTML Used For?

HTML is used to build the skeleton of every web page on the internet. It
tells the browser:

* What content to display
* How that content is structured
* What parts are headings, lists, links, images, or paragraphs

Without HTML, a browser wouldn’t know what your site contains - or even where
to begin on how to display anything to the user.

### What Does HTML Code Look Like?

Here’s a small example:

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Page</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph of text.</p>
```

The `<h1>` tag creates a heading.
The `<p>` tag creates a paragraph.
These tags are knowns as **HTML elements**, and they follow a consistent
pattern that your browser understands.

### How HTML Works in the Browser

When you open a web page, your browser reads the HTML from top to bottom. It
doesn’t care about colors or spacing (that’s what CSS is for). Its job is to
figure out:

* What kind of content each tag contains
* How it should be arranged on the page
* What the document’s hierarchy or structure looks like

If HTML is the skeleton, CSS is the skin and clothing - and JavaScript is the
nervous system that adds behavior. For now, we’re focused on the bones.

### What Can’t HTML Do?

It’s important to understand HTML’s limits:

* HTML **can’t add behavior** like responding to a button click (JavaScript
  does that).
* HTML **can’t change the layout dynamically** (CSS and JS do that).
* HTML **can’t store or process data** on its own.

Its one job is to **describe the content**.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If you’ve ever used bold or italic in a word processor, you’ve used
> formatting. HTML does the same thing—only with tags instead of buttons.
