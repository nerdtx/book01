## Section 5: Converting Between Hex and Decimal

Now that you understand what hexadecimal is and how it relates to binary, let’s
learn how to convert between **hexadecimal** (base-16) and **decimal**
(base-10), the number system that humans actually use every day.

### Hex to Decimal Conversion

To convert a hexadecimal number into decimal, treat each digit as a power of 16,
just like you do with powers of 10 in the decimal system.

This sounds a bit dubious, so let's detour with base10 first.

If you have the number 123, intuitively you know that as:

`(1×100) + (2×10) + (3×1)`

Or even more abstractly, you can see that as:

`(1×10²) + (2×10¹) + (3×10⁰)`

**It's the same with hex but instead of 10, the base is 16.**

#### Example: Convert `0x3A` to decimal

If we are given a hex value of `0x3A`, the conversion is straightforward by
breaking down each digit given it's placement.

`(3×16¹) + (A×16⁰) = (3×16) + (10×1) = 58`

So.. `0x3A = 58` in decimal.

### Decimal to Hex Conversion

To convert from decimal to hex:

1. Divide the number by 16.
2. Record the remainder (this becomes the least significant digit).
3. Divide the result again by 16, this is the next digit. Repeat.
4. Stop when the quotient is 0.
5. Convert remainders to hex digits.

#### Example: Convert `255` to hex

| Step | Divide   | Quotient | Remainder | Hex Digit |
| ---- | -------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| 1    | 255 ÷ 16 | 15       | 15        | F         |
| 2    | 15 ÷ 16  | 0        | 15        | F         |

Read from bottom to top: `0xFF`

Therefore, `255 = 0xFF`

### Hexadecimal Summary Table

| Hex    | Decimal |
| ------ | ------- |
| `0x0`  | 0       |
| `0xA`  | 10      |
| `0x10` | 16      |
| `0x3A` | 58      |
| `0xFF` | 255     |

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Any time you see `0x` in front of a number, it’s just a computer’s way of
> saying, "I’m in base16 now."
