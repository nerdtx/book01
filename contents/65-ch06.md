## Section 5: Radio Buttons and Checkboxes

When you're collecting input from a user, sometimes you want to give them a list
of choices. HTML provides two special input types for this: **radio buttons**
(for *one* selection) and **checkboxes** (for *multiple* selections).

### Radio Buttons

Radio buttons are used when you want the user to choose **only one** option from
a group. Just like the buttons on an old car radio, selecting one turns off the
others.

#### Example

```html
<p>Choose your favorite pet:</p>

<label>
  <input type="radio" name="pet" value="dog">
  Dog
</label>

<label>
  <input type="radio" name="pet" value="cat">
  Cat
</label>

<label>
  <input type="radio" name="pet" value="turtle">
  Turtle
</label>
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> All radio buttons in the same group must share the same `name` attribute. This
> is what links them together and limits the user to just one choice.

### Checkboxes

Checkboxes are for when you want the user to be able to select **more than one**
option. Each checkbox operates independently.

#### Example

```html
<p>Which colors do you like?</p>

<label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="color" value="red">
  Red
</label>

<label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="color" value="green">
  Green
</label>

<label>
  <input type="checkbox" name="color" value="blue">
  Blue
</label>
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> With checkboxes, each box with the same `name` creates an array of values. If
> a user checks "Red" and "Blue", both are submitted together.

### Visual Styling

Browsers display these input types using small circular (radio) or square
(checkbox) buttons. While the default look is basic, they can be customized
later with CSS.

### Default Selections

You can pre-select an option using the `checked` attribute:

```html
<input type="radio" name="pet" value="cat" checked>
```
