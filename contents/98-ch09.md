## Section 8: Nested Data Structures

As your programs get more complex, you’ll often need to organize your data in
more advanced ways. That’s where **nested data structures** come in. A **nested
structure** is when an array or object contains *other arrays or objects*
inside it.

This is extremely common in real-world applications, especially when you're
dealing with APIs, user data, or settings.

### Arrays of Objects

One very useful structure is an *array of objects* — each object can represent something like a person, a product, or a record.

```js
let students = [
  { name: "Taylor", grade: 10 },
  { name: "Jordan", grade: 11 },
  { name: "Avery", grade: 9 }
];
```

You can loop through the array and access properties inside each object:

```js
for (let student of students) {
  console.log(`${student.name} is in grade ${student.grade}`);
}
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Remember that array items are accessed with `[index]` and object properties
> with `.key`. Combine them when working with arrays of objects.

### Objects Containing Arrays

Sometimes, a *single object* needs to store a list — this is where objects
containing arrays come in:

```js
let classroom = {
  name: "Room 203",
  subjects: ["Math", "Science", "History"]
};

console.log(classroom.subjects[1]); // "Science"
```

You can loop through the array inside the object:

```js
for (let subject of classroom.subjects) {
  console.log(subject);
}
```

### Objects Inside Objects

You can also nest *objects within objects*, often used to organize related
data.

```js
let user = {
  name: "Alex",
  contact: {
    email: "alex@example.com",
    phone: "555-1234"
  }
};

console.log(user.contact.email); // "alex@example.com"
```

### Putting It All Together

Nested structures can get deep and complex:

```js
let school = {
  name: "NerdTX Academy",
  students: [
    { name: "Kai", age: 14, classes: ["English", "Math"] },
    { name: "Riley", age: 15, classes: ["Science", "History"] }
  ]
};
```

Accessing deeply nested values looks like this:

```js
console.log(school.students[1].classes[0]); // "Science"
```

### Why This Matters

Nested data is exactly what you’ll see when working with:

* Web APIs
* Game state
* Form submissions
* Configuration files (like JSON)

Being able to read and navigate these structures is essential for frontend and
backend programming.
