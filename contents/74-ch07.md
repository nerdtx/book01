## Section 4: Variables and Data Types

Computers are great at remembering things — but only if you tell them exactly
what to remember and how. In JavaScript, this is done through **variables**.

A variable is like a labeled box that holds a piece of information for later
use. You give it a name, and you can store all kinds of data inside — a number,
a word, or even something more complex.

### Declaring a Variable

To create a variable, you use the `let` or `const` keyword followed by the
variable’s name.

```js
let age = 16;
const name = "Jordan";
```

* Use `let` when the value might change later.
* Use `const` when the value should stay the same.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Avoid using `var`. It still works, but it behaves differently in ways that can
> be confusing. Stick to `let` and `const`.

### Variable Naming Rules

Variable names:

* *Must start* with a letter, `$`, or `_`
* *Cannot start* with a number
* *Cannot contain spaces*
* Should be descriptive and written in *camelCase* style:

  * Ok `studentName`
  * No `student_name` (still works, but less common in JavaScript)


> **Helpful Hint:**
> Different languages have a different preference on variable naming.  Use
> the conventions of that particular language.

### JavaScript Data Types

There are a few basic **types** of data you’ll use:

| Type      | Example              | Description                                 |
| --------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Number    | `42`, `3.14`, `-10`  | Any whole or decimal number                 |
| String    | `"hello"`, `'world'` | Text (wrapped in quotes)                    |
| Boolean   | `true`, `false`      | Represents a yes/no or on/off state         |
| Undefined | `undefined`          | Variable declared but not yet given a value |
| Null      | `null`               | Explicitly means “nothing”                  |

### Type Checking

You can check the type of a variable using the `typeof` keyword:

```js
let score = 100;
console.log(typeof score); // "number"
```

### Practice

Try declaring a few variables of your own:

```js
let favoriteColor = "blue";
const yearBorn = 2008;
let hasPet = true;
```

Use `console.log()` to print them and verify their types.
