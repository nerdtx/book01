## Section 3: Basic Output in JavaScript

Once you've embedded JavaScript into a web page, the next step is to **make it
do something**. At this stage, the easiest and most useful tool you have is the
*browser console*.

### The Console

Every modern browser comes with a set of **developer tools**,
including a “Console” tab. This is where you can:

* See the results of your JavaScript code
* View messages from your program
* Spot errors when something goes wrong

To open the Console:

* On Windows: Press `F12` or `Ctrl + Shift + I`, then click the "Console" tab
* On macOS: Press `Cmd + Option + I`


### The `console.log()` Function

The `console.log()` function is your best friend when you're starting out. It
prints text into the console so you can confirm your code is running and see
values of variables.

Example:

```js
console.log("This message appears in the console!");
```

This line of code doesn’t display anything on the web page itself — only in the
developer console.


### Try It Yourself

Let’s create a small HTML page with JavaScript that logs something to the
console:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Console Example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Open the Console!</h1>

    <script>
      console.log("Welcome to JavaScript!");
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

Open this file in your browser, open the Console, and you’ll see the message.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Don’t forget that JavaScript is case-sensitive — `Console.Log` is not the same
> as `console.log`.


### Other Output Functions

Although you'll mostly use `console.log()` for now, there are a few other
built-in output methods you may run into later:

* `alert("Hello!")` – Pops up a message box
* `confirm("Are you sure?")` – Displays OK/Cancel dialog
* `prompt("What is your name?")` – Asks for user input

We’ll explore those later when we talk about interaction. For now,
*focus on writing code and watching its output in the console.*
