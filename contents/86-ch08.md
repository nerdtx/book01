## Section 6: The `for` Loop

When you know *how many times* you want to repeat something, the `for` loop is
your go-to tool. It’s compact, powerful, and ideal for counting through a range
of numbers.

### Basic Structure

```js
for (start; condition; update) {
  // code that runs each loop
}
```

A `for` loop has *three parts* in the parentheses:

1. **Start** – runs once at the beginning
2. **Condition** – checked before each loop; must be true to keep looping
3. **Update** – runs after each loop

### Example: Counting to 5

```js
for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i = i + 1) {
  console.log(i);
}
```

This prints:

```
1
2
3
4
5
```

Let’s break it down:

* `let i = 1` sets up the counter
* `i <= 5` is the condition
* `i = i + 1` increases `i` each time

### Looping Over Items

You can use a `for` loop to repeat a task multiple times — such as printing
messages, making table rows, or checking multiple inputs.

```js
for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
  console.log("Welcome!");
}
```

This prints “Welcome!” three times.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The `i` variable is short for “index” and is a common name for loop counters,
> but you can use any variable name you want.

### When to Use `for` vs. `while`

| Use `for` when...           | Use `while` when...                      |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| You know how many times     | You don’t know how many times            |
| You’re counting or stepping | You’re waiting for a condition to change |
