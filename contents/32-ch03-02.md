## Section 2: Tags, Elements, and Nesting

HTML uses **tags**, or special sequences of characters, to describe and organize
content. These tags tell the browser what each part of the page is supposed to
be - whether it’s a heading, paragraph, image, or something else entirely.

Understanding how tags work - and how to nest them correctly - is essential for
writing valid, functional HTML.

### The Anatomy of an HTML Element

HTML tags often come in pairs: an **opening tag** and a **closing tag**.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

* `<p>` is the **opening tag**
* `</p>` is the **closing tag** (note the slash `/`)
* The content inside is the **element’s content**

Together, the opening tag, content, and closing tag form an **HTML element**.

### Common Tag Patterns

| Tag Type   | Example                  | Description                          |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Heading    | `<h1>Title</h1>`         | A main heading                       |
| Paragraph  | `<p>Text here</p>`       | A paragraph of text                  |
| Emphasis   | `<em>Important</em>`     | Italic text for emphasis             |
| Strong     | `<strong>Alert</strong>` | Bold text for strong importance      |
| Line break | `<br>`                   | A single line break (no closing tag) |
| Image      | `<img src="cat.jpg">`    | Displays an image (no closing tag)   |

Note: Some tags, like `<br>` and `<img>`, are **self-closing** or **void
elements**. They don’t wrap around content and don’t require a closing tag.

### Nesting Elements

**Nesting** means placing one element inside another. This helps define
structure.

Here’s a simple example:

```html
<p>This is a <strong>very important</strong> sentence.</p>
```

In this case:

* The `<p>` element wraps the whole sentence.
* The `<strong>` element wraps just the bold portion.

This would look like:

> This is a **very important** sentence.

**Rules of nesting:**

1. Tags must close in the reverse order they’re opened (no crossing).

2. Never overlap tags like this:

  ```html
    <p><strong>Wrong way</p></strong> <!-- This will confuse the browser -->
  ```

  Notice that the `<p>` opens before the `<strong>` but then is closed before
  the `<strong>` closes.  This is incorrect and can confuse the browser when it
  tries to **render** the page (or draw the page for the user to consume).

  Instead, this is correct:

  ```html
  <p><strong>Right way</strong></p>
  ```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Think of HTML like boxes inside boxes. Always close the inner box before
> closing the outer one.
