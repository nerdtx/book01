## Section 4: Page Sections and Layout Thinking

So far, you’ve seen how to wrap and group content using `<div>` elements. Now
let’s take that a step further and think about the big picture: how a whole
page is structured into **sections**.

Well-organized web pages are often broken into standard regions. You’ve seen
these before—even if you didn’t realize it. Open just about any website, and
you’ll notice distinct zones:

* A **header** with a logo or title
* A **main content** area
* Possibly a **sidebar**
* A **footer** at the bottom

These are the building blocks of most websites. And you can build this same
structure using `<div>` elements.

### Layout Skeleton with Divs

Here’s an example of a basic layout using only divs and clear labeling:

```html
<div id="page">
  <div id="header">
    <h1>My Site</h1>
  </div>

  <div id="content">
    <p>Welcome to my website. Here is some important info.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="footer">
    <p>Contact: email@example.com</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

This may look simple, but it introduces a mindset: **think in blocks**. Each
block (or section) serves a different purpose. You are starting to build
layouts that can grow, be styled, and eventually become interactive.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use `id` attributes for unique page sections like `header`, `content`, and
> `footer`. You can then use these IDs to style or target specific parts of
> your page with CSS and JavaScript.

### Divs Without CSS

Even without any CSS, divs allow you to:

* Visually group your ideas as you write HTML
* Label and comment sections for clarity
* Make your code more maintainable and readable

In future chapters, you’ll style these divs and position them on the page. For
now, focus on **clear structure** and **logical grouping**.
