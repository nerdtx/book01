## Section 6: More HTML in Practice

In the previous section, we built a simple page.  Let's add to that a bit and
dive into the tags a bit more.

---

### Step 1: Create a new HTML File

Open your text editor and type the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My Second Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hi again</h1
    <p>
      This is my SECOND webpage and it has a
      <a href="index.html">link</a> to the first page.
    </p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then save the file with the name `second.html`. Make sure it ends with `.html`
(not `.txt` or anything else).  Be sure to save this file in the same folder as
the original `index.html` page from the previous section.

---

### Step 2: Open the File in Your Browser

Find the file `second.html` on your computer and double-click it. Your browser
will open it like a normal website.

You should see:

* A bold heading that says "Hi again"
* A paragraph underneath with a link.

Now _click that link_.  If all is built properly, your browser will **navigate**
(or change the page you are viewing) to the first page you built.  Try hitting
the back button in your browser, it should return you to your `second.html`
page.

**Congratulations** - you have actually built a web!

---

### Step 3: Make Changes and Refresh

Now try editing the file. In the `<body>` tag, under your `<p>..</p>`, add a
list with a header.

```html
...
    <p>
      This is my SECOND webpage and it has a
      <a href="index.html">link</a> to the first page.
    </p>
    <h2>These are my favorite movies</h2>
    <ul>
    <li> [First Favorite Movie] </li>
    <li> [Second Favorite Movie] </li>
    <li> [Third Favorite Movie] </li>
    </ul>
...
```

Save the file, then _refresh the browser_ to see the changes.

**What do you see?**

### Step 4: Add an Image

Let's pull in the nerdtx logo to your page.

Edit it, adding the image at the bottom of the page, before the closing
`</body>` tag.

```html
...
   <img src="https://nerdtx.dev/imgs/nerdtx.png">
   </body>
```

When you refresh the page now, if this is correct, it should pull in the logo to
the page and render the image at the bottom of the content.
