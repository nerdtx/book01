## Section 7: File Uploads and Textareas

In addition to buttons, dropdowns, and checkboxes, you’ll often want to collect
**larger pieces of content** or allow users to **upload files**. HTML offers
built-in support for both.

### The `<textarea>` Tag

When users need to type more than a single line - like a comment, review, or
long story about a a wild trip to the Congo
- the `<textarea>` tag is the best tool. Unlike an `<input>`, it creates a
multi-line text box.

#### Example

```html
<label for="bio">Tell us about yourself:</label>
<textarea id="bio" name="bio" rows="5" cols="40"
  placeholder="Write something interesting..."></textarea>
```

* `rows` sets the height (how many lines tall)
* `cols` sets the width (roughly the number of characters)
* The content between the tags becomes default text

> **Helpful Hint:**
> `<textarea>` is not self-closing. Always remember to use both opening and
> closing tags.

### File Uploads with `<input type="file">`

To let users upload images, PDFs, or any other files, use this input:

```html
<label for="resume">Upload your resume:</label>
<input type="file" id="resume" name="resume">
```

This adds a "Choose File" button to the form.

#### Multiple Files

To allow more than one file:

```html
<input type="file" name="photos" multiple>
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Browsers restrict what types of files can be accessed for security reasons.
> You can't read the file directly in HTML without help from JavaScript or
> uploading it to a server.

---

### Accepting Only Certain File Types

Use the `accept` attribute to restrict the types of files that can be selected:

```html
<input type="file" name="photo" accept="image/*">
```

This will only allow image files like `.jpg`, `.png`, or `.gif`.

Other examples:

* `accept=".pdf"` – Only allows PDFs
* `accept="image/png,image/jpeg"` – Only allows PNG or JPEG images


---

### Important Note for File Uploads

If you plan to actually *send* uploaded files to a backend or server, the
`<form>` must include the attribute:

```html
enctype="multipart/form-data"
```

But if you're just learning frontend HTML, you won't need this yet.
