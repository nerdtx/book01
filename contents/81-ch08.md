# Chapter 8: Javascript Control Flow

## Section 1: Making Decisions with `if` Statements

In programming, we often need to tell the computer: “Only do this if a certain
condition is true.” That’s where the **`if` statement** comes in — it allows
your code to make decisions **if** something is true or false.

### The Basic Structure

```js
if (condition) {
  // code runs if condition is true
}
```

If the condition inside the parentheses evaluates to `true`, the code inside the
curly braces is executed. If it’s `false`, that block is skipped.

### Example

```js
let temperature = 75;

if (temperature > 70) {
  console.log("It's warm outside!");
}
```

Since `temperature > 70` is `true`, the message will appear in the console.

### Comparison Operators

To write useful conditions, you’ll need to compare values. JavaScript provides
the expected set of operators to accomplish this:

| Operator | Meaning               | Example   | Result  |
| -------- | --------------------- | --------- | ------- |
| `===`    | Equal to (strict)     | `5 === 5` | `true`  |
| `!==`    | Not equal to (strict) | `5 !== 3` | `true`  |
| `<`      | Less than             | `3 < 10`  | `true`  |
| `<=`     | Less than or equal    | `4 <= 4`  | `true`  |
| `>`      | Greater than          | `9 > 2`   | `true`  |
| `>=`     | Greater than or equal | `8 >= 9`  | `false` |

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Always use `===` instead of `==`. It compares both value **and** type, which
> avoids confusing bugs.

### Using Conditions with Variables

Let’s say you’re building a voting eligibility checker:

```js
let age = 17;

if (age >= 18) {
  console.log("You can vote!");
}
```

In this case, the condition `age >= 18` is false, so nothing is printed.

Now try changing the value of `age` to test the condition.

### Practice: Conditional Greeting

```js
let hour = 14;

if (hour < 12) {
  console.log("Good morning!");
}

if (hour >= 12) {
  console.log("Good afternoon!");
}
```

This kind of logic is common — the computer chooses which message to display
depending on the time of day.
