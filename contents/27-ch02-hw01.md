## Assignment – DNS & IP Lookup Worksheet

### Objective

In this assignment, you’ll explore how your computer communicates with the
internet by identifying the key parts of a URL, tracing how a domain becomes an
IP address, and seeing what’s happening behind the scenes of a basic web
request.

You’ll use built-in tools or websites to answer real questions about how DNS
and IP addressing work.

### Part 1: Break Down a URL

Given this URL, answer the following:
`https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computing`

1. What is the **protocol**?
   → \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

2. What is the **domain**?
   → \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

3. What is the **path**?
   → \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

4. Are there any **query parameters**? (If yes, write them)
   → \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### Part 2: DNS Lookup

Use one of the following tools to find the IP address of a domain:

* Command Line:
  * macOS/Linux: `dig example.com` or `nslookup example.com`
  * Windows: `nslookup example.com`
* Online DNS Tool:
  * [https://dnslookup.org/](https://dnslookup.org/)
  * [https://who.is/](https://who.is/)

5. What IP address does your domain resolve to?
   → \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
6. Can you find more than one IP (e.g., for different servers or regions)?
   → \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
7. Look up the IP on a geolocation tool (like iplocation.net). Where is it located?
   → \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### Part 3: Trace the Route

Use `traceroute` (macOS/Linux) or `tracert` (Windows) to see how your data
travels to the server.

Example:
`traceroute example.com`
or
`tracert example.com`

8. How many hops (routers) did your request pass through?
   → \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
9. What was the final destination IP address?
   → \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
10. Based on the output, was there any delay or timeout in the route?
    → \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### Part 4: Measuring Response Time

Try using the `ping` tool to measure how long it takes for you to send a message and get an answer back from the server.

Try `ping example.com` and record:

11. The IP address it pings: \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
12. The average round-trip time (ms): \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

### Summary

By completing this worksheet, you’ll have a clearer understanding of:

* How your browser turns a name into a number
* How data is routed across the internet
* How to interpret tools like `ping`, `traceroute`, and `nslookup`

**Helpful Hint:**
The more curious you are about where your data goes, the more fluent you'll
become in how the internet really works—beyond just using it.
