# Historical Figure - Vannevar Bush

## The Man Who Dreamed the Web Before It Existed

In 1945, long before the modern computer or internet existed, **Vannevar Bush**
imagined a machine that could store, organize, and retrieve information in a way
that mimicked how the human brain works. He called it the **Memex**.

While Bush didn’t invent the web, his ideas deeply influenced those who
did - especially Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web.

## What Was the Memex?

The Memex (short for “memory extender”) was a theoretical desk-like machine
where a person could:

* Store huge amounts of information
* Link documents to one another
* Retrieve items using trails of related content

It was based on the idea that knowledge is best explored through
_association_, not just categories or indexes. Bush believed that people think
in terms of connected ideas and machines should support that kind of
exploration. Topics were _associated_ to other topics via attributes or related
bits of information about them.

Sound familiar?

That’s exactly how the **hyperlink**, or connection between two web resources,
works on the web today.

## Bush’s Legacy in Web Architecture

Bush’s vision planted the seed for concepts we now take for granted:

* Clicking a **link** to jump between documents
* Following a **trail** of related information
* Structuring the internet as a **web** of ideas, not a straight line

His famous essay, *As We May Think*, was published in 1945 and
inspired generations of scientists and engineers to think beyond traditional
libraries and printed materials.

Another little known fact - at MIT, Bush was the mentor of Claude Shannon. How's
that for association?
