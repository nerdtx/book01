# Chapter 4: Cascading Style Sheets

## Section 1: What Is CSS and Why Use It?

Until now, you’ve written pages using HTML—the language of structure. HTML
tells the browser _what_ is on the page: paragraphs, headings, lists, links,
and images.

But it doesn’t say _how_ those things should look.

That’s where **CSS** comes in.

### What Is CSS?

**CSS** stands for **Cascading Style Sheets**. It is a language used to
describe the visual appearance and formatting of an HTML document.

CSS doesn’t replace your HTML. Instead, it works _with_ it, controlling the
colors, fonts, layout, spacing, and even animations that bring a web page to
life.

If HTML is the **skeleton**, then CSS is the **clothing**.

### Why Use CSS?

Before CSS, styling had to be done directly inside HTML using attributes like
`bgcolor`, `font`, or `align`. This made code messy, hard to maintain, and
difficult to update across multiple pages.

CSS solved that problem by:

* Separating content from presentation
* Making styling reusable and scalable
* Allowing multiple style rules to combine and apply across a site

With CSS, you can:

* Set a site-wide font in one line
* Change the color of all your links at once
* Control spacing and layout across all pages

### What Does “Cascading” Mean?

The term *cascading* refers to how CSS resolves conflicts between multiple
rules. If two different styles try to apply to the same element, CSS uses a
hierarchy of rules to decide which one “wins.” This is known as
**specificity**, (the condition of applying to a particular condition), and
you'll learn more about it later.

For now, just know: **the more specific the rule, the higher priority it has**.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> A style defined directly in an HTML element (inline) will override styles in
> an internal or external stylesheet—unless you use special tricks, which we’ll
> cover later.

In the next section, you’ll learn three different ways to apply CSS to your
HTML: inline, internal, and external.
