## Section 2: Introduction to Arrays

In JavaScript, an **array** is a special type of variable that can hold
*multiple values* in a specific order. Instead of having to create a new
variable for every item, you can store a list of values inside one array.

### What Does Creating an Array Look Like?

An array can be written using **square brackets**, with each item separated by a
comma:

```js
let colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
let scores = [95, 87, 72, 100];
let mixed = ["hello", 42, true];
```

You can store strings, numbers, Booleans — even other arrays or objects.  You
can also mix and match the items in an array. Some numbers, some strings, etc.

### Accessing Items in an Array

Each item in an array has a *position*, called an **index**, starting from `0`.

```js
let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

console.log(fruits[0]); // "apple"
console.log(fruits[1]); // "banana"
console.log(fruits[2]); // "cherry"
```

Trying to access an index that doesn’t exist returns `undefined`.

### Changing Items in an Array

You can change a specific item by assigning a new value to a specific index:

```js
fruits[1] = "blueberry";
console.log(fruits); // ["apple", "blueberry", "cherry"]
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Arrays are **mutable**, meaning you can add, remove, or change items after the
> array has been created.

### Arrays Can Be Empty (at First)

You don’t have to fill an array immediately:

```js
let todoList = [];
todoList[0] = "Do homework";
todoList[1] = "Feed the cat";
```

This allows you to build arrays dynamically as your program runs.

### Why Arrays Matter

Arrays are useful in all sorts of scenarios. Here's a couple of clues that you
should probably be using an array in your code:

* You need to *store and organize many values*
* You want to *loop through* those values
