## Section 4: Function Expressions and Anonymous Functions

So far, you’ve learned how to define functions using the standard `function`
keyword followed by a name. But in JavaScript, functions can also be stored in
variables and even passed around like values. These are called **function
expressions** — a powerful way to treat functions as data.

### Function Expressions

A **function expression** is a function defined inside an assignment:

```js
const greet = function(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
};

greet("Jordan");  // Output: Hello, Jordan!
```

Notice two important things:

1. The function does **not** have a name (it’s anonymous — more on that soon).
2. It is assigned to a variable called `greet`, which can then be called like
   any other function.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Semicolons are required after function expressions, because they are part of
> an assignment statement.

### Anonymous Functions

An **anonymous function** is simply a function without a name:

```js
function() {
  console.log("I have no name!");
}
```

You can’t use an anonymous function by itself, but you *can* assign it to a
variable or pass it into another function.

Example:

```js
const sayHello = function() {
  console.log("Hello!");
};
```

This is now a named expression — it behaves just like a regular function. You
just gave it a name by assigning it to a variable.

Anonymous functions are commonly used when writing **short, one-time
functions**, especially when passing them into other functions.

```js
setTimeout(function() {
  console.log("This runs after 2 seconds.");
}, 2000);
```

Here, the function is never reused, so giving it a name isn’t necessary.

### First-Class Functions

In JavaScript, **functions are first-class citizens**. This means:

* You can assign them to variables
* You can pass them as arguments to other functions
* You can return them from other functions

This is a key feature of JavaScript and opens the door to more advanced patterns
(like callbacks and closures, which you’ll encounter later).
