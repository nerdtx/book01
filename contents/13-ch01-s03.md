## Section 3: Binary Numbers

To understand how computers process and store information, you must understand
how they count—and computers count in **binary**.

### What Is Binary?

The binary number system is a **base-2** system. It uses only two digits:

* `0` (off)
* `1` (on)

This is fundamentally different from the decimal system (base-10), which uses
ten digits: `0` through `9`.

Why two digits? Because binary maps perfectly onto the **electrical nature of
computers**: a switch is either on or off. No in-between. By combining many
switches, computers can represent all kinds of data—numbers, letters, images,
sounds - using patterns of `1`s and `0`s.

### Counting in Binary

Let’s count from zero to ten in binary to see the pattern:

| Decimal | Binary | | Decimal | Binary |
| ------- | ------ | - | ------- | ------ |
| 0       | 0000   | | 6       | 0110   |
| 1       | 0001   | | 7       | 0111   |
| 2       | 0010   | | 8       | 1000   |
| 3       | 0011   | | 9       | 1001   |
| 4       | 0100   | | 10      | 1010   |
| 5       | 0101   | | 11      | 1011   |


Notice how each new value follows the same pattern as decimal counting - but
rolls over much more quickly because there are only two digits available.

### Bits and Place Value

Each binary digit is called a **bit** (short for "binary digit"). Like in
decimal, the position of each digit determines its value:

* Binary `1011` means:

  `(1 × 8)` + `(0 × 4)` + `(1 × 2)` + `(1 × 1)` = `8 + 0 + 2 + 1` = **11**

Here’s how to break that down:

| Position | Value | Bit | Value × Bit    |
| -------- | ----- | --- | -------------- |
| 3        | 8     | 1   | 8              |
| 2        | 4     | 0   | 0              |
| 1        | 2     | 1   | 2              |
| 0        | 1     | 1   | 1              |
|          |       |     | **Total = 11** |

Each additional bit doubles the maximum number you can represent.

* 4 bits → max value: 15
* 8 bits → max value: 255
* 16 bits → max value: 65,535

We’ll return to these limits later when we look at colors and memory.
