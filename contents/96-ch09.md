## Section 6: Accessing and Updating Object Data

Once you've created an object, the real power comes from being able to *read*,
*update*, and *dynamically access* the data inside. This section focuses on
working with that data more flexibly and programmatically.

### Reading Data with Dot Notation

Dot notation is the cleanest and most common way to access a known property:

```js
let user = {
  name: "Alex",
  age: 15
};

console.log(user.name); // "Alex"
```

You can chain dot notation to reach deeper structures:

```js
let profile = {
  name: "Jordan",
  address: {
    city: "Austin",
    state: "TX"
  }
};

console.log(profile.address.city); // "Austin"
```

### Reading Data with Bracket Notation

Bracket notation is useful when:

* You don’t know the property name ahead of time
* The property name has spaces or special characters

You can also chain bracket notation.

```js
let key = "name";
console.log(profile[key]); // "Jordan" from the example above

console.log(profile["profile"]["address"]["city"]); // Austin
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If the property name is stored in a variable or includes a space, you must use
> bracket notation.

### Updating Data

Just like with variables, you can reassign values in an object:

```js
user.age = 16;
user["name"] = "Alexa";
```

### Adding New Properties

You can also add new properties simply by assigning to them:

```js
user.grade = 10;
user["grade"] = 10; // same as above
```

Now the `user` object looks like this:

```js
{
  name: "Alexa",
  age: 16,
  grade: 10
}
```

### Checking for a Property

You can check whether an object has a specific key:

```js
console.log("email" in user);      // false
console.log(user.hasOwnProperty("age")); // true
```

This is helpful when you’re not sure whether a piece of data has been defined
yet.

### Deleting Properties

To remove a property:

```js
delete user.grade;
```

### Summary Table

| Action           | Syntax Example                                |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Access (dot)     | `obj.key`                                     |
| Access (bracket) | `obj["key"]`                                  |
| Update property  | `obj.key = newValue`                          |
| Add property     | `obj.newKey = value`                          |
| Check for key    | `"key" in obj` or `obj.hasOwnProperty("key")` |
| Delete property  | `delete obj.key`                              |

You’ll use these techniques constantly — whether working with user profiles, API
data, form inputs, or game state. In the next section, you’ll explore how to
loop through objects and interact with their contents in more advanced ways.
