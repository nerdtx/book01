# Chapter 7: JavaScript

## Section 1: What Is JavaScript?

JavaScript is one of the core technologies of the modern web, alongside HTML and
CSS. While HTML defines the structure of a page, and CSS controls its
appearance, *JavaScript brings it to life* by making it interactive and
adaptive.

If HTML is the noun, and CSS is an adjective, then JavaScript is a verb. It's
dynamic and allows interactivity within the web page and not just between the
user and the server.


Whenever you:

* Click a button and see new content appear,
* Submit a form and get immediate feedback,
* Scroll down and watch new images load automatically,

...you’re probably seeing JavaScript at work.

### A Short History of JavaScript

JavaScript was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich in just 10 days while working at
Netscape. Originally designed to add small interactions to web pages, it has
grown into a full-fledged programming language capable of running complex
applications in the browser — and even on servers.

Despite the name, *JavaScript is not related to Java*. The name was chosen for
marketing reasons during the rise of the Java programming language, but they are
very different in both purpose and design.

### Why JavaScript Matters

JavaScript is the only programming language that runs
*natively in all web browsers*. You don’t need to install anything special —
just write your code in a text editor, and the browser does the rest.

As you continue through this book, you’ll use JavaScript to:

* Create interactive forms
* Respond to user actions (like clicks and keypresses)
* Show or hide elements on a page
* Validate input and provide feedback
* Build full web applications

### JavaScript Runs in the Browser

JavaScript is executed by the browser’s **JavaScript engine**, a highly complext
runtime for the JavaScript execution environment.

Each JavaScript runtime environment is a unique project contained inside the
browser.  As of Oct 2025:

* Chrome uses V8
* Firefox uses SpiderMonkey
* Safari uses JavaScriptCore

These are very advanced components that include a compiler, optimizations layers
and then runtime layers.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> You can open the developer tools in any browser (usually with F12 or
> right-click → "Inspect") and go to the “Console” tab to run JavaScript live.
