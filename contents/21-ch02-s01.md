# Chapter 2: The Internet and How Computers Talk

## Section 1: What Is the Internet?

When you open your browser and visit a website, it may seem like something
magical happens. But under the hood, you’re interacting with one of the most
complex and vast engineering feats in human history: **the Internet**.

Let’s break it down—clearly, practically, and from the ground up.

### The Internet Is a Network of Networks

The word **internet** comes from “inter-networking.” At its core, the internet
is simply a **huge network made by connecting smaller networks together**. Each
computer or device in this global system can send and receive information using
a shared set of rules called **protocols**.

* Your laptop is part of your home network.
* Your home network connects to your ISP (Internet Service Provider).
* Your ISP connects to a larger network, which connects to another, and so on.
* Eventually, this path leads to the server that hosts the website or resource
  you want.

Even a tiny message may pass through **dozens or hundreds of computers, cables,
and routers** before it reaches its destination—and it does so in a fraction of
a second.

### Key Terms

Let’s define a few important words:

* **Node**: Any device connected to a network (a computer, phone, printer, etc.)
* **Packet**: A small chunk of data that travels across a network
* **Protocol**: A defined set of rules that devices follow when they talk to
  each other

### The Internet vs. the Web

These two terms are often used interchangeably, but they are not the same:

* **The Internet** is the infrastructure: the physical and digital network
  connecting devices across the world.
* **The Web** (short for World Wide Web) is a service that runs on the internet.
  It includes websites, pages, and links—things accessed through your browser.

Think of it this way:

> The internet is the road system. The web is just one kind of vehicle that
> drives on it.

Other things that use the internet (but aren’t part of the web) include:

* Email (SMTP, IMAP)
* Video chat (like Zoom or FaceTime)
* Online games
* Messaging apps

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The internet isn't just one thing - it's a *conversation* between machines.
> And just like in real life, conversations only work if everyone agrees on the
> rules! People interrupt each other? One person speaks in an unknown language?
> It wouldn't work.
