## Section 2: Clients and Servers

To understand how the internet works, you need to know who’s asking the
questions—and who’s answering them.

Every time you load a website, download a file, or check your email, you’re part
of a conversation between two machines: a **client** and a **server**.

### What Is a Client?

A **client** is any device or program that sends a request for information. When
you:

* Open your browser and go to `https://nerdtx.dev`
* Tap the “Refresh” button in an app
* Ask your smart speaker what the weather is

...you’re using a **client** to ask for something.

**Your web browser** is one of the most common types of clients. It sends
messages to servers and waits for responses.

### What Is a Server?

A **server** is a computer designed to wait for incoming requests and respond to
them. It might:

* Send back a web page
* Deliver a file
* Store your messages
* Run a game world

Servers don’t usually initiate conversations—they sit quietly until a client
speaks first. But they are always ready to respond.

### The Client–Server Model

The internet is built on this model of interaction:

> **Clients ask. Servers answer.**

Let’s look at how it plays out in a typical scenario:

1. Your browser (client) sends a request for a web page at `example.com`.
2. A server at `example.com` receives the request.
3. The server prepares the requested content.
4. It sends the content (often HTML, CSS, JavaScript) back to your browser.
5. Your browser displays it.

### Analogy: Ordering at a Restaurant

| Role    | Internet Equivalent | Example                         |
| ------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| You     | Client              | Your browser                    |
| Waiter  | Protocol (HTTP)     | Communication rule              |
| Kitchen | Server              | Web server that prepares a page |
| Menu    | URL                 | `https://example.com/about`     |
| Dish    | Response Data       | HTML content, images            |

You, the _client_, place an order. The kitchen, the _server_, prepares and
returns it. The waiter (HTTP) makes sure everything is delivered properly.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The server doesn’t know you exist until you ask for something. So be
> specific - and polite (with the right URL).
