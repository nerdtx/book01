## Section 3: Combining Conditions with Logical Operators

So far, we’ve written `if` statements that check one condition at a time. But in
real-world code, you often need to check **more than one thing at once**.
JavaScript allows this with **logical operators**.

These operators let you combine conditions using logic — just like you'd say in
real life:

* "If I have my ID **and** I'm over 18..."
* "If it's raining **or** snowing..."

### The Logical Operators

| Operator | Meaning                 | Example                             |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `&&`     | AND — both must be true   | `age >= 18 && hasID`              |
| `\|\|`     | OR — at least one is true | `isRaining \|\| isSnowing`          |
| `!`      | NOT — reverses truth      | `!isLoggedIn` means “not logged in” |

### Using `&&` (AND)

This is true **only if both parts are true**.

```js
let age = 20;
let hasID = true;

if (age >= 18 && hasID) {
  console.log("You may enter.");
}
```

Both conditions must be true for the message to appear.

### Using `||` (OR)

This is true if **either** (or both) are true.

```js
let isWeekend = true;
let hasHoliday = false;

if (isWeekend || hasHoliday) {
  console.log("You can sleep in today.");
}
```

Only one needs to be true for the message to print.

### Using `!` (NOT)

The **NOT** operator flips the value. If something is true, `!` makes it false,
and vice versa.

```js
let isLoggedIn = false;

if (!isLoggedIn) {
  console.log("Please log in.");
}
```

This is common when checking whether something **has not happened yet**.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> You can combine multiple logical operators in a single expression — but use
> parentheses for clarity:

> ```js
> if ((age > 12 && age < 18) || hasParentalConsent) {
>   console.log("You may proceed.");
> }
> ```
