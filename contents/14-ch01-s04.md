## Section 4: Number Bases and Hexadecimal

So far, we've seen two number systems:

* **Decimal (base-10)** – used by humans
* **Binary (base-2)** – used by computers

Now we’ll introduce a third: **Hexadecimal (base-16)**.

### What Is a Number Base?

A **number base** is the number of unique digits used to count before “rolling
over” to the next place value.

* **Base-10**: digits `0`–`9`
* **Base-2**: digits `0`–`1`
* **Base-16**: digits `0`–`9` and `A`–`F`
  (Where `A` = 10, `B` = 11, ..., `F` = 15)

Each digit in a number is multiplied by a power of the base, based on its
position from right to left.

### Why Base-16?

Binary is powerful, but it becomes unreadable quickly. Consider this byte of
data:

* Binary: `11010111`

That’s eight bits—a common chunk of data—but it’s hard to interpret at a glance.
Now compare:

* Hex: `D7`

The hex version represents the exact same data.

Hexadecimal is used extensively in computing as a shorthand for binary.  There
are also historical hardware related reasons for why hexadecimal was so
prevalent.  Ever heard of a 16 bit computer or 32 bits? That's 32 bits that
could be used at a time to do things like address memory.

### Mapping Binary to Hex

Because **one hex digit** represents **exactly four binary digits**, conversion
is straightforward.

| Binary | Hex | Decimal | | Binary | Hex | Decimal |
| ------ | --- | ------- | - | ------ | --- | ------- |
| 0000   | 0   | 0 | | 1001   | 9   | 9 |
| 0001   | 1   | 1 | | 1010   | A   | 10 |
| 0010   | 2   | 2 | | 1011   | B   | 11 |
| 0011   | 3   | 3 | | 1100   | C   | 12 |
| 0100   | 4   | 4 | | 1101   | D   | 13 |
| 0101   | 5   | 5 | | 1110   | E   | 14 |
| 0110   | 6   | 6 | | 1111   | F   | 15 |
| 0111   | 7   | 7 | | 10000   | 10   | 16 |
| 1000   | 8   | 8 | | 10001   | 11   | 17 |

To convert a binary number to hex:

1. Split the binary into groups of 4 bits (add leading 0s if needed).
2. Convert each group into a hex digit.

Example:
Binary `11010111` → groups: `1101` `0111`
→ Hex: `D7`
