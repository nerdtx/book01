## Section 6: Patterns in HTML Layouts

Now that you’ve learned how to use `<div>` elements and label them with `id`
and `class`, let’s look at some **layout patterns** you’ll see often in
real-world web development.

These patterns give you a starting point for building pages that are
well-organized, easy to read, and simple to style later.

### The Wrapper Pattern

One common technique is wrapping your entire page in a single top-level
container called a “wrapper.” This helps you control the overall width, center
your content, or apply a background color to the whole page.

```html
<div id="wrapper">
  <div id="header">...</div>
  <div id="content">...</div>
  <div id="footer">...</div>
</div>
```

The `wrapper` groups everything on the page. Later, you’ll use CSS to center it
or apply consistent padding around all content.

### The Column Layout

Another pattern is dividing your page into **columns** - for example, a main
area and a sidebar.

```html
<div id="page">
  <div id="main-content">
    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>This is the important part of the page.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="sidebar">
    <h3>Related Links</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Link A</li>
      <li>Link B</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</div>
```

You’ll use CSS later to display these side-by-side, but for now, just focus on
organizing the content clearly.

### Repeating Blocks

If you have repeating elements (like blog posts, cards, or items), it’s a good
idea to use a `class` to keep them consistent.

```html
<div class="card">
  <h3>Item 1</h3>
  <p>Some details about this item.</p>
</div>

<div class="card">
  <h3>Item 2</h3>
  <p>More details here.</p>
</div>
```

You’ll learn how to style all `.card` elements at once using CSS.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> When you find yourself writing the same structure more than once, it’s a
> great opportunity to use a class. You’re thinking like a developer when you
> spot patterns in your layout.

### Avoiding “Div Soup”

Be careful not to overuse `<div>` for everything. If your page becomes a sea of
nested divs with no clear purpose, it’s called **div soup**. You’ll learn how
to avoid this by using **semantic HTML** in the next chapter.

For now, just remember:

* Group things when they belong together
* Label your divs with intention
* Use clean indentation and comments to stay organized
