## Section 2: Declaring and Calling a Function

To use a function in JavaScript, you must first **declare** it (define what it
does), and then **call** it (run the instructions it contains). This two-step
process is essential to how functions work.

### Declaring a Function

A **function declaration** starts with the `function` keyword, followed by:

1. A name for the function
2. A pair of parentheses, which may include parameters
3. A block of code inside curly braces (`{}`)

Here’s the structure:

```js
function greet() {
  console.log("Hello there!");
}
```

This function is called `greet`. When it runs, it prints a message to the
console.

### Calling a Function

To actually make the function run, write its name followed by parentheses:

```js
greet();
```

This tells JavaScript: “Go execute the instructions inside the `greet` function.”

> **Helpful Hint:**
> A function can be called as many times as you like, and from anywhere in your
> code - even from inside another function!

### Parameters and Arguments

Functions can take **parameters** — placeholders for input values. These values
can be passed in when the function is called.

Example:

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

In this case, `name` is the **parameter**.

You pass in an **argument** when calling the function:

```js
greet("Taylor");  // Output: Hello, Taylor!
```

If a function takes multiple parameters, separate them with commas:

```js
function add(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}

add(3, 4);  // Output: 7
```

### Return Values

Functions can also produce a **result** by using the `return` keyword. When a
function returns something, that value can be used elsewhere in your program.

Example:

```js
function square(n) {
  return n * n;
}

let result = square(5);
console.log(result);  // Output: 25
```

Without a `return` statement, the function completes but produces no usable value.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> A `return` statement immediately ends the function. Anything written after
> `return` inside the same function won't run.
