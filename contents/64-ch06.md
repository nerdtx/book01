## Section 4: Input Types and Validation

Modern HTML forms can collect many kinds of information. Whether you’re asking
for a birthday, email address, or favorite number, you can use different **input
types** to improve accuracy and guide the user experience. HTML also includes
simple **validation rules** to check the input before it gets submitted.

### Common Input Types

Each `input` tag has a `type` attribute that tells the browser what kind of
input you want. Here are a few examples:

| Input Type | Purpose                    | Example                   |
| ---------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `text`     | Basic single-line text     | `<input type="text">`     |
| `email`    | Email address format       | `<input type="email">`    |
| `number`   | Numeric input with spinner | `<input type="number">`   |
| `date`     | Calendar date selector     | `<input type="date">`     |
| `password` | Hides characters as typed  | `<input type="password">` |
| `url`      | Accepts web URLs           | `<input type="url">`      |
| `tel`      | Telephone number format    | `<input type="tel">`      |

Each of these types gives hints to the browser and allows for more targeted
validation and behavior.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> On mobile devices, using the right `type` can bring up the correct keyboard
> (like numbers for `type="tel"`), which makes forms easier to fill out.

### Built-in Validation Attributes

You can enforce rules on user input using basic attributes. These work without
writing any JavaScript.

#### `required`

Prevents the form from submitting until the field is filled.

```html
<input type="text" name="username" required>
```

#### `min` and `max`

For numeric or date inputs, you can limit the allowed range.

```html
<input type="number" name="age" min="0" max="120">
```

#### `pattern`

Uses a regular expression (regex) to validate text.

```html
<input type="text" name="zipcode" pattern="\d{5}">
```

This example only allows exactly five digits, like `78701`.

#### `maxlength`

Limits the number of characters a user can type.

```html
<input type="text" name="nickname" maxlength="12">
```

#### `placeholder`

Provides a hint inside the input box to show expected format or content.

```html
<input type="email" placeholder="you@example.com">
```

### Example: Email Signup

```html
<form>
  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" id="email" name="email"
    required placeholder="you@example.com">
  <input type="submit" value="Subscribe">
</form>
```

This form won’t submit unless the user types a valid-looking email.
