## Section 3: CSS Syntax – Selectors, Properties, and Values

Now that you know where CSS goes, it's time to learn how it works.

Every CSS rule follows the same basic structure:

```css
selector {
  property: value;
}
```

This simple pattern is the building block of all styling within CSS.

### Selectors

A **selector** tells the browser _which element_ to style.

Here are the most common types:

* **Element Selector**: Targets all instances of a tag

  ```css
  p {
    color: blue;
  }
  ```

* **ID Selector**: Targets a single element with a specific `id` (note the `#`)

  ```css
  #header {
    background-color: lightgray;
  }
  ```

  ```html
  <h1 id="header">Hello!</h1>
  ```

* **Class Selector**: Targets all elements with a specific `class` (note the `.`)

  ```css
  .highlight {
    background-color: yellow;
  }
  ```

  ```html
  <p class="highlight">This would be bright</p>
  ```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use **element** selectors for broad styling, **class** selectors for reusable
> styling, and **id** selectors for unique elements.


### Properties and Values

Inside the curly braces, you list **properties** (the name of the attribute)
you want to change, and assign each one a **value**.

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 24px;
  color: navy;
}
```

Each line in the example above:

* Starts with a **property name** (like `color` or `font-size`)
* Has a colon `:`
* Followed by a **value** (like `navy` or `24px`)
* Ends with a semicolon `;`

The semicolon tells the browser the statement is complete. Missing it can break your rule.

It is also possible to combine these on one line.

```css
h1 { font-size: 24px; color: navy; }
```

### Practice Example

Here’s a short example applying multiple styles:

```css
body {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  margin: 40px;
}
```

This rule:

* Sets a light gray background for the page
* Changes the font to Arial
* Adds space around the body’s content

In the next section, you’ll apply these skills to change the color and
typography of your page.
