## Section 6: Basic Math with JavaScript

JavaScript isn’t just for handling text and interactivity — it also does math.
Whether you’re building a calculator, tracking a score, or manipulating data,
you’ll need to know how to use basic arithmetic operators.


### The simple stuff works

If you've had any sort of math class, some of this will look very familiary.

Imagine seeing this:

```js
let x = 4 + 7;
```

Intuitiely, you will think to yourself, "x is holding 11".

Turns out the basic math operations are straight-forward with JavaScript.

### Arithmetic Operators

JavaScript supports all the usual math operations:

| Operator | Name                | Example (`a = 10`, `b = 4`) | Result |
| -------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- | ------ |
| `+`      | Addition            | `a + b`                     | 14     |
| `-`      | Subtraction         | `a - b`                     | 6      |
| `*`      | Multiplication      | `a * b`                     | 40     |
| `/`      | Division            | `a / b`                     | 2.5    |
| `%`      | Remainder (modulus) | `a % b`                     | 2      |

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The `%` (modulus) operator returns what’s left over after division. For
> example, `10 % 4` equals `2` because 4 goes into 10 twice, with 2 left over.

### Operator Precedence

Just like in math class, JavaScript follows the standard order of operations
(PEMDAS):

```js
let result = 4 + 2 * 3;  // 10, not 18!
```

To force a different order, use parentheses:

```js
let result = (4 + 2) * 3;  // 18
```

### Incrementing and Decrementing

There are shortcuts for adding or subtracting 1:

```js
let count = 0;
count++; // adds 1
count--; // subtracts 1
```

You can also use `+=` or `-=` to add or subtract any value:

```js
let score = 10;
score += 5; // now score is 15
score -= 2; // now score is 13
```

### Math in Action

```js
let width = 10;
let height = 5;
let area = width * height;

console.log("Area is " + area); // Area is 50
```

We'll use these basic operations to build up to more advanced topics.
