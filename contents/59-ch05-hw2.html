## Assignment 2 – Build a Structured Page Using Divs and CSS

In this assignment, you will combine everything from this chapter to create a
**structured, styled HTML page** that demonstrates both organization and layout
skills. By completing it, you’ll practice using `<div>` containers, applying CSS
widths, and experimenting with CSS Grid for page design.

---

### Assignment: A Personal Homepage with Layout

Build a simple personal homepage that includes **at least four major regions**:

* A **header** (page title and subtitle)
* A **main content area** (short biography or description of yourself)
* A **sidebar** (list of links, hobbies, or favorite quotes)
* A **footer** (basic contact info or copyright notice)

---

### Requirements

Your page must meet the following:

1. **HTML Structure**

   * Use at least 4 `<div>` elements to define major regions
   * Assign each div a meaningful `id` or `class` (e.g. `id="header"`)
   * Use comments in your HTML to mark each section

2. **CSS Styling**

   * Set widths for your major divs (using either pixels or percentages)
   * Demonstrate use of at least two different display types (`block`,
     `inline-block`, or `none`)
   * Include at least one centered block using `margin: auto`
   * Apply simple background colors to distinguish sections

3. **CSS Grid**

   * Create a page layout using CSS Grid with at least 2 columns and 2 rows
   * Place your header at the top, footer at the bottom, and divide main
     content/ sidebar into columns
   * Use `grid-template-columns` and `grid-template-rows`

### Example (Simplified)

```html
<div id="page">
  <div id="header">My Homepage</div>
  <div id="sidebar">Sidebar links here</div>
  <div id="content">Main content goes here</div>
  <div id="footer">Footer info</div>
</div>
```

```css
#page {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 25% 1fr;
  grid-template-rows: auto 1fr auto;
  gap: 10px;
}

#header {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

#sidebar {
  background-color: lightgray;
}

#content {
  background-color: white;
}

#footer {
  grid-column: 1 / 3;
  background-color: lightblue;
}
```

---

### Goal

When finished, your page should feel **organized and intentional**—not a pile of
elements stacked on top of each other. The assignment is not about making a
“pretty” design yet, but about mastering **structure and layout**.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Build your HTML first, then apply CSS step by step. Get the structure working
> before worrying about exact colors or spacing.
