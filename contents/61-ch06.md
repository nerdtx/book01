# Chapter 6: Forms

## Section 1: Why Forms Matter

Have you ever submitted a comment on a website, signed up for an email list, or
filled out a login form? These everyday tasks rely on one of the most powerful
and essential features of the web: the HTML form.

At the core, a form is simply a way for a website to ask a question and wait for
an answer.

### What Forms Do

In a world full of static content, forms are how web pages listen. They
allow users to:

* Enter their name, email, or password
* Vote in a poll
* Choose from a list of options
* Leave feedback
* Upload files
* Make selections that customize what the page does next

Without forms, websites couldn’t collect information or respond to user choices.
Forms enable interaction and are the foundation of dynamic, personalized web
experiences.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Any time you see a button that says “Submit,” you’re probably dealing with an
> HTML form.

### The Role of Forms in Applications

In later chapters, you’ll learn how forms work together with JavaScript and APIs
to build fully interactive apps. But for now, we start with the structure: how
forms are written, what inputs look like, and how they group information
together.

Think of this chapter as learning how to build a **questionnaire** that your
browser can understand.
