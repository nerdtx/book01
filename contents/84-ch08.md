## Section 4: Boolean Values and Expressions

You’ve already seen conditions like `if (age >= 18)`, but what exactly is
happening inside that `if`? The expression `age >= 18` is evaluated to a
**Boolean** value — a value that is either `true` or `false`.

Boolean logic is at the heart of all decision-making in JavaScript.
Understanding how it works will help you write clearer, more predictable code.

### Boolean Values

There are only two Boolean values:

```js
true
false
```

These are not strings — they are a *special data type* used to represent
truth. You can assign Boolean values to variables directly:

```js
let isLoggedIn = true;
let hasAccess = false;
```

### Boolean Expressions

A **Boolean expression** is something that evaluates to either `true` or `false`.

Examples:

```js
5 > 3                  // true
2 === 4                // false
"hello" !== "goodbye"  // true
```

When you write an `if` statement, JavaScript runs the expression and checks
whether it’s truthy.

### Truthy and Falsy

JavaScript will treat some values *as if* they were `true` or `false` — even
if they aren’t literally `true` or `false`.

| Falsy Values         |
| -------------------- |
| `false`              |
| `0`                  |
| `""` (empty string)  |
| `null`               |
| `undefined`          |
| `NaN` (Not a Number) |

Everything else is considered *truthy* — it will act like `true` in a condition.

```js
let name = "";

if (name) {
  console.log("Thanks for entering your name!");
} else {
  console.log("You left it blank.");
}
```

Since an empty string is falsy, the second message prints.

### Common Mistakes

* Using assignment `=` instead of comparison `===`

  ```js
  if (x = 5)  // Wrong! This sets x to 5, and always evaluates as true
  if (x === 5)  // Correct
  ```

* Forgetting that some values like `0` and `""` count as falsy

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If you’re ever unsure whether a value is truthy or falsy, try logging it:
>
> ```js
> console.log(Boolean(value));
> ```
