## Section 6: URLs and Query Parameters

Whenever you visit a website, click a link, or fill out a form online, you’re
using a **URL**. URLs are more than just web addresses - they’re compact
messages that tell a browser where to go and what to request.

### What Is a URL?

**URL** stands for **Uniform Resource Locator**. It’s the address your browser
uses to request a specific resource (like a page, image, or video) on the
internet.

Here’s a simple URL:

```
https://example.com/about
```

This tells your browser to:

* Use the **HTTPS protocol**
* Contact the server at `example.com`
* Request the resource located at `/about` on that server

### Anatomy of a URL

Let’s break down a more detailed example:

```
https://nerdtx.dev/search?q=llama
```

| Part         | Meaning                                          |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `https`      | Protocol (secure HTTP)                           |
| `nerdtx.dev` | Domain (the server to talk to)                   |
| `/search`    | Path (which resource or page is being requested) |
| `?q=llama`   | Query string (extra information being sent)      |

### What Are Query Parameters?

**Query parameters** allow clients to send small pieces of data along with
their request—like search terms or filters. They are added after a `?` and
written as **key-value pairs** (the key is the name of the data element, the
value is the actual data).

Example:

```
https://store.com/products?category=books&page=2
```

This URL is asking for:

* The `products` page
* Filtered by `category=books`
* Showing `page=2`

Multiple parameters are separated by `&`:

```
?key1=value1&key2=value2
```

We could visualize that a different way.

| name of data | value of data |
| ------------ | ------------- |
| key1         | value1        |
| key2         | value2        |

### Why Are Query Parameters Useful?

They allow data to be embedded into the request location instead of having to
perform a different request (of a different type like POST) just to send
potentially dynamic data values.

Let's put this a different way.

The `/search` path on a server.

By having a query parameter, you can search for all sorts of things at the same
page.

* `/search?term=movies`
* `/search?term=flowers`
* `/search?term=hw1+solutions`

Without query parameters, the server would have to host a different page for
all of these and developers would have to know ahead of time which searches
that a user would make.


### Where You’ll See Query Parameters

**Everywhere.**

* Search engines:
  `https://www.example..com/search?q=html+basics`
* Online stores:
  `https://shop.example.com/items?sort=price&available=true`
* Web apps:
  `https://calendar.example.com/view?date=2024-05-20`

### Reading Tip:

Always read query strings from left to right, starting at the `?`:

* Everything before the `?` tells where to go (server and path).
* Everything after the `?` provides additional details about the request.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If a URL looks confusing, copy just the part before the `?` into your
> browser. That’s usually the base page.
