## Section 3: Wrapping and Nesting Elements

Now that you understand what a `<div>` does, let’s look at how to use it
effectively. The real power of `<div>` comes from _wrapping_ related content
together and _nesting_ structure inside other structure.

### Wrapping Content

To “wrap” means to surround multiple related elements with a single container.
This makes them behave like one unit, which is helpful for layout, styling, and
organization.

Here’s an example:

```html
<div>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>I’m a student who loves programming, drawing, and exploring new ideas.</p>
</div>
```

In this case, the heading and the paragraph are part of the same topic.
Wrapping them in a `<div>` shows they belong together.

### Why Wrapping Matters

When you start adding CSS or JavaScript later on, you'll often want to style or
interact with entire sections. Wrapping makes this easy.

For example:

* You can apply background color or spacing to the whole group
* You can hide or show an entire section with one command
* You can move blocks of content around without breaking the layout

### Nesting Divs

You can also place a `<div>` inside another `<div>`. This is called _nesting_.

Example:

```html
<div id="main-content">
  <div class="article">
    <h3>Article Title</h3>
    <p>This is the article content.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="article">
    <h3>Another Article</h3>
    <p>This is more content.</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Here, the `main-content` div contains two `article` divs. Each article has its
own heading and paragraph, but they’re grouped under a single parent container.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Indent your code when nesting. It helps you see which tags are inside others
> and makes your HTML much easier to read.

Next, you’ll learn how these wrapped and nested containers can be used to
structure an entire page with different sections.
