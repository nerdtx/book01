## Section 3: Basic Form Elements

Now that you understand how to set up a form, let’s explore the most fundamental
components you’ll use to collect information from a user: **text inputs, labels,
and the submit button**. These form the foundation of nearly every user
interaction on the web.

---

### Text Input (`<input type="text">`)

This is the most common form field. It allows the user to enter a single line of
text, such as a name, email, or short answer.

Example:

```html
<input type="text" name="firstName">
```

If this input is inside a form, the browser will capture whatever the user types
in and associate it with the `name` you provided (`firstName` in this case).

---

### The `<label>` Tag

Every input should be paired with a `<label>`. This improves accessibility and
usability, especially for screen readers or when clicking on labels to focus the
input field.

There are two ways to write a label:

1. **Wrap the input inside the label**:

```html
<label>
  First Name:
  <input type="text" name="firstName">
</label>
```

2. **Link the label to the input using `for` and `id`**:

```html
<label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
<input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName">
```

Both approaches are valid, though the second is more flexible for layout
styling.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Clicking on a label that’s correctly linked to an input will automatically
> focus that input field. This is an easy win for user experience.

### Multiline Input: `<textarea>`

If you need a user to enter multiple lines of text (like a comment or message),
use the `<textarea>` tag:

```html
<label for="message">Your Message:</label>
<textarea id="message" name="message" rows="4" cols="40"></textarea>
```

Unlike the `<input>` tag, `<textarea>` is not self-closing. You can even put
default text between the opening and closing tags.

---

### Submit Button (`<input type="submit">`)

To trigger the form submission, use this tag:

```html
<input type="submit" value="Send">
```

The `value` becomes the text on the button.

---

### Putting It All Together

```html
<form>
  <label for="firstName">First Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="firstName" name="firstName">

  <label for="message">Message:</label>
  <textarea id="message" name="message"></textarea>

  <input type="submit" value="Send">
</form>
```

This small form asks for a name and a message, and lets the user submit the
input.
