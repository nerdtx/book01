## Section 3: Function Scope and Variables

As your programs grow, you’ll start to notice something called **scope** — the
idea that some variables are only available in certain parts of your code. This
is one of the most important concepts to understand when working with functions.

### What Is Scope?

In JavaScript, **scope** determines where variables can be accessed. Functions
create a **local scope** — any variable declared inside a function is *not*
visible outside of it.

Example:

```js
function greet() {
  let name = "Taylor";
  console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

greet();        // Output: Hello, Taylor
console.log(name);  // Error! 'name' is not defined outside the function
```

Here, `name` only exists inside the `greet()` function. It’s *local* to that
function.

### Global vs Local Scope

* **Global scope** means a variable is declared outside any function. These can
  be accessed anywhere.
* **Local scope** means a variable is declared inside a function and can only be
  used there.

```js
let user = "Chris";  // Global variable

function greet() {
  let greeting = "Hello";
  console.log(greeting + ", " + user);
}
```

In this case, `user` is global (and accessible inside the function), but
`greeting` is local.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If a function doesn't find a variable inside its local scope, it will look in
> the outer (global) scope. But the reverse isn't true — global code cannot see
> inside a function's scope.

### Scope Pollution

**Scope pollution** happens when too many variables are declared in the global
scope, which increases the risk of naming collisions and bugs.

Bad practice:

```js
let counter = 0;

function increment() {
  counter++;
}
```

Better practice:

```js
function increment(current) {
  return current + 1;
}
```

Using local variables and returning values helps avoid accidental changes to
global data.

### Best Practices for Variable Scope

* Always declare variables with `let` or `const` inside functions unless you
  absolutely need them globally.
* Avoid reusing the same variable name in different scopes.
* Keep functions small and focused to reduce scope complexity.
