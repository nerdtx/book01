## Section 6: Dropdowns with `<select>` and `<option>` Tags

When space is limited or you want to keep a form tidy, dropdown menus are a
great way to present a list of choices. HTML provides two essential elements for
this: `<select>` and `<option>`.

---

### Creating a Dropdown Menu

The `<select>` tag creates the dropdown, and each `<option>` inside it
represents one of the available choices.

#### Example: Choosing a Favorite Language

```html
<label for="language">Favorite Programming Language:</label>
<select name="language" id="language">
  <option value="python">Python</option>
  <option value="javascript">JavaScript</option>
  <option value="c++">C++</option>
  <option value="rust">Rust</option>
</select>
```

This code displays a dropdown with four choices. The `value` attribute in each
`<option>` is the data that gets submitted when the form is sent.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The `label` tag is important for accessibility and usability. Clicking the
> label will focus the dropdown if it’s properly linked using the `for` and `id`
> attributes.

---

### Setting a Default Selection

By default, the first `<option>` in the list will be selected. To choose a
different default, use the `selected` attribute:

```html
<option value="javascript" selected>JavaScript</option>
```

---

### Grouping Options

Use the `<optgroup>` tag to visually separate related choices. This is helpful
when you have a long list of options.

```html
<select name="vehicle">
  <optgroup label="Cars">
    <option value="jeep">Jeep</option>
    <option value="tesla">Tesla</option>
  </optgroup>
  <optgroup label="Motorcycles">
    <option value="honda">Honda</option>
    <option value="yamaha">Yamaha</option>
  </optgroup>
</select>
```

This creates a dropdown where "Cars" and "Motorcycles" appear as separate
labeled groups.

---

### Submitting Data

When the form is submitted, the `name` of the `<select>` and the `value` of the
chosen `<option>` are sent just like other inputs.

In the next section, we’ll look at how to let users upload files and how to
design forms for sending larger pieces of data.
