# Chapter 10: JavaScript Functions

## Section 1: What Is a Function?

A function in JavaScript is a **block of reusable code** that performs a
specific task. Rather than writing the same lines of code over and over, you can
write a function once and use it whenever you need it. This makes your code
**cleaner**, **easier to understand**, and **simpler to maintain**.

Functions are one of the most important tools in programming. They allow you to
organize logic into small, well-named chunks. If you’ve ever built with LEGO
bricks, you already understand the idea: instead of one massive structure, you
create smaller pieces and snap them together to form something bigger. That’s
exactly what functions do in code.

### Why Use Functions?

Here are a few reasons functions are essential:

* **Reusability**: Write the logic once and call it multiple times.
* **Modularity**: Break your program into understandable pieces.
* **Abstraction**: Hide complex steps behind a single name.
* **Debugging Ease**: Smaller chunks of code are easier to test and fix.

For example, imagine you have this simple task:

```js
console.log("Hello, Alex!");
console.log("Hello, Riley!");
console.log("Hello, Jordan!");
```

You could wrap this logic in a function like this:

```js
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
```

Now you can call it repeatedly:

```js
greet("Alex");
greet("Riley");
greet("Jordan");
```

This is cleaner and more flexible.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> A good function should do one thing well and be named clearly so that someone
> reading the code knows exactly what it does.

### A Function Has Two Lives

Functions work in two stages:

1. **Definition**: This is where you describe what the function does.
2. **Call (or Invocation)**: This is where you actually tell the function to
   run.

Example:

```js
// Definition
function sayHello() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}

// Call
sayHello();
```

The `sayHello` function won't do anything until you *call* it. Think of defining
a function like writing a recipe — it tells the computer *how* to do something.
But nothing gets cooked until you use that recipe.
