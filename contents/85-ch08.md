## Section 5: The `while` Loop

Sometimes you want your code to repeat — but you’re not sure exactly how many
times it will need to. That’s where the **`while` loop** comes in.

A `while` loop keeps running *as long as its condition is true*.

### Basic Structure

```js
while (condition) {
  // code that repeats
}
```

Before every repetition, JavaScript checks the condition. If it’s `true`, the
loop runs again. If it’s `false`, the loop stops.

### Example: Counting Up

```js
let count = 1;

while (count <= 5) {
  console.log("Count is: " + count);
  count = count + 1;
}
```

This prints:

```
Count is: 1
Count is: 2
Count is: 3
Count is: 4
Count is: 5
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If you forget to change the value of `count`, this loop will run forever!
> Always make sure your loop condition will eventually become false.

### Real-World Example: Password Prompt

```js
let password = "";

while (password !== "open123") {
  password = prompt("Enter the password:");
}

console.log("Access granted!");
```

This keeps asking the user for the password until they enter the correct one.

### Infinite Loops

A loop that *never ends* is called an *infinite loop*. Be careful when writing
`while` loops — if the condition *never becomes false*, your code may freeze
the browser or crash.

Bad example:

```js
while (true) {
  console.log("This never stops!");
}
```

### Best Use Cases

* Waiting for user input
* Repeating actions until something changes
* Looping until a condition is met, without knowing the number of times
