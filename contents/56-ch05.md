## Section 6: Using CSS for Width and Display

So far, you’ve used `<div>` elements to group content and organize a page into
logical blocks. But structure alone isn’t enough—you also need to control how
much space each block takes up and how it is displayed on the page. That’s where
**CSS width and display properties** come in.

---

### Element Widths

Many HTML elements are rendered to be full width.  This means they start on a
new line and use all available width of the screen (or technically their
parent container).

It is possible to change this behavior of an element in CSS by setting the
`display:` property.  For now, we will focus on the four fundamental display
types.

| display type | behavior |
| - | - |
| block | elements start on a newline and stretch from left to right of parent container |
| inline | elements do not start on a newline and are only as wide as their content requires |
| block-inline | elements do not start on a newline but their sizing properties can be changed to control their dimensions and spacing |
| none | element is removed from the document render and is invisible |

### Controlling Width

The **`width`** property sets how wide an element should be. By default, a
`<div>` stretches across the entire page. Changing its width allows you to make
narrower sections or arrange multiple divs side by side.

```css
#sidebar {
  width: 200px;
}
```

You can also use percentages, which scale relative to the page size:

```css
#content {
  width: 70%;
}
```

Using percentages makes your design more flexible when viewed on different screen sizes.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If you want a maximum size but still allow shrinking, use `max-width` instead
> of `width`. This prevents layouts from breaking on smaller screens.

### Using the Display Property for Layout

By overriding the display property on a div, it is possible to customize the
layout of your page.

To create a layout with two divs side by side, one possible method uses
`inline-block`:

```css
.column {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 45%;
  margin: 10px;
}
```

This places two divs in the same row, each taking up 45% of the page width.

### Centering with Margin Auto

One common layout trick is to center a div on the page. You can do this by
setting a fixed width and using `margin: auto`:

```css
#main {
  width: 800px;
  margin: auto;
}
```

This evenly distributes leftover space on both sides, centering the block.

### Putting It Together

Here’s a quick example with a content area and a sidebar:

```css
#content {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 70%;
  vertical-align: top;
  background-color: green;
}

#sidebar {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 25%;
  vertical-align: top;
  background-color: red;
}
```

With just a few rules, you’ve moved from a flat page to a **two-column layout**.


Here's the html to take advantage of your new CSS skills.

```html

<div id="sidebar">
<h2> menu </h2>
<ul>
  <li> link 1 </li>
  <li> link 2 </li>
  <li> link 3 </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="content">
<h1> main content area </h1>
<p>
you would put interesting things here.
</p>
</div>
```

By creating a page that rolls all of these items together, you can generate a
columnar layout that provides for a side menu and a main content area.
