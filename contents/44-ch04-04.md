## Section 4: Styling Text and Colors

CSS gives you control over how text appears on your web page—font, size, color,
spacing, and alignment can all be customized to match your design. In this
section, you’ll learn how to make your text readable, consistent, and visually
appealing.

### Font Size and Font Family

The `font-size` property sets how large or small your text is.

```css
p {
  font-size: 16px;
}
```

You can use values like `px` (pixels), `em` (relative size), or `%`:

```css
h1 {
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

The `font-family` property defines which font to use.

Not all fonts are available on all browsers or operating systems.

Therefore, it's a good idea to list a few options with the first preference to
the left and the safe fallback to the right.

```css
body {
  font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;
}
```

If the first font isn’t available, the browser tries the next one until it
finds one.

### Text Color and Background Color

Use the `color` property to change text color:

```css
h1 {
  color: darkgreen;
}
```

Use `background-color` to change the background behind the text:

```css
p {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
```

You can specify colors by:

* **Named values** (like `blue`, `tomato`)
* **Hexadecimal** (like `#FF6600`)
* **RGB** (like `rgb(255, 0, 0)`)

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Hex color codes use base-16. For example, `#FF0000` is pure red, and
> `#00FF00` is pure green.

### Text Alignment

The `text-align` property lets you control horizontal alignment:

```css
h2 {
  text-align: center;
}
```

Options include `left`, `right`, `center`, and `justify`.

### Making Links Stand Out

Use the `a` selector to style links:

```css
a {
  color: #0077cc;
  text-decoration: none;
  background-color: #d0d0d0;
}
```

This example turns off the underline, gives links a custom blue color, and
gives them a light gray background.

### Putting It Together

Here’s a sample CSS block applying several styles at once:

```css
body {
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
  color: #333333;
  background-color: #ffffff;
}

h1 {
  font-size: 28px;
  color: navy;
  text-align: center;
}
```

These simple changes can make a big difference in how your page feels to a
visitor.

In the next section, you’ll learn how to manage spacing around and inside your
elements using **margin** and **padding**.
