## Section 7: Nested Loops and Looping Patterns

Sometimes one loop isn’t enough. You may need a *loop inside another loop* —
this is called a **nested loop**. Nested loops are especially useful when
dealing with grids, tables, or multi-step tasks.

### What is a Nested Loop?

It’s simply a loop that runs *inside another loop*. The outer loop runs first.
For each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop runs completely.

```js
for (let row = 1; row <= 3; row++) {
  for (let col = 1; col <= 4; col++) {
    console.log(`Row ${row}, Column ${col}`);
  }
}
```

This would print:

```
Row 1, Column 1
Row 1, Column 2
Row 1, Column 3
Row 1, Column 4
Row 2, Column 1
... and so on
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> The inner loop resets every time the outer loop repeats.

### Common Uses for Nested Loops

* Drawing patterns or grids
* Processing tables of data
* Looping over items that are grouped

Example: Creating a simple multiplication table:

```js
for (let x = 1; x <= 3; x++) {
  for (let y = 1; y <= 3; y++) {
    console.log(`${x} × ${y} = ${x * y}`);
  }
}
```

### Be Cautious of Complexity

Each extra loop adds more repetitions. For example, a 3×3 grid means the inner
loop runs 9 times total. A 10×10 grid? That’s 100 iterations.

If your loops get too large, it can slow down the browser or be hard to manage.

### Looping Patterns

Nested loops are just one kind of looping pattern. Other patterns include:

* Counting backward (`for (let i = 10; i >= 1; i--)`)
* Skipping values (`i = i + 2` to count even numbers)
* Combining conditionals and loops to solve puzzles
