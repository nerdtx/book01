## Section 2: Expanding Decisions with `else` and `else if`

In the previous section, you learned how to use a basic `if` statement to
execute code only when a condition is true. But most real-world decisions have
more than one possible outcome. That’s where **`else`** and **`else if`** come
in.

These let your program **choose between multiple paths** of logic.

### `if` and `else`

Use `else` to define an alternate block of code when the `if` condition is
*not true*.

```js
let isRaining = false;

if (isRaining) {
  console.log("Bring an umbrella!");
} else {
  console.log("No umbrella needed today.");
}
```

Here, the `else` block runs *only if* the `if` condition is false.

### Adding More Conditions with `else if`

Sometimes you want to check *more than two* possibilities. You can chain
multiple conditions using `else if`.

```js
let score = 85;

if (score >= 90) {
  console.log("You got an A!");
} else if (score >= 80) {
  console.log("You got a B!");
} else if (score >= 70) {
  console.log("You got a C!");
} else {
  console.log("You might need to study more.");
}
```

JavaScript checks the conditions *in order*:

* If one is true, it runs that block and skips the rest.
* If none are true, it runs the final `else` (if present).

### How Many `else if`s Can You Have?

As many as you want. Just keep in mind:

* *Order matters* — once a true condition is found, the rest are ignored.
* You *don’t have to* use `else` at the end — it’s optional.

### Common Use Cases

* Grading systems (like the example above)
* Categorizing ages or prices
* Handling menu choices or user responses

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Always test your conditions carefully to avoid unreachable code. If your first
> `if` is too broad, the `else if`s might never run.
