## Section 5: Margins, Padding, and Spacing

When a web page looks crowded or messy, the issue usually isn’t the
content - it’s the spacing. Good design depends heavily on space.

CSS gives you two powerful tools for managing space: margin and padding.

### The Box Model

Every HTML element is treated like a rectangular box. The **box model** is how
CSS thinks about and controls that box.

Here’s how it works, from the inside out:

1. **Content** – The text or image inside the element
2. **Padding** – Space between the content and the border
3. **Border** – The edge of the box
4. **Margin** – Space outside the border, between this element and others

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Padding is inside the element’s box. Margin is outside the box. If you’re
> trying to add space between two elements, use **margin**.

### Setting Padding and Margin

You can set padding or margin using the `padding` and `margin` properties:

```css
p {
  padding: 10px;
  margin: 20px;
}
```

You can also set each side individually:

```css
p {
  padding-top: 10px;
  padding-right: 15px;
  padding-bottom: 10px;
  padding-left: 15px;
}
```

### Padding and Margin Shorthand

It is possible, and quite convenient, to set multiple sides with one
property.

```css
div {
  margin: 10px 20px;  /* Top/Bottom: 10px, Left/Right: 20px */
}
```

This shorthand version reads like a clock and applies the side properties
depending on how many values are provided.

* 1 value: same value to all sides
* 2 values: first value to top/bottom, second value to left/right
* 4 values: values specified in the order of top, right, bottom, left

```css
.all-sides { margin: 10px ; }
.two { margin: 10px 20px;  /* Top/Bottom: 10px, Left/Right: 20px */ }
.four { margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px; }
}
```

> **Helpful Hint**
> When four values are given to the `margin` property, think of them like a
> clock.  Starting at the top then moving clockwise around the box.

### Practical Examples

Given the example below:

```css
h1 {
  margin-bottom: 30px;
}

article {
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: #f9f9f9;
}
```

These rules space out the header and give some breathing room inside the
article.

Well-used spacing makes your site look professional, readable, and pleasant to
use. In the next section, you’ll learn some helpful shortcuts and patterns that
keep your CSS clean and efficient.
