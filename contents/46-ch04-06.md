## Section 6: Helpful CSS Shortcuts and Grouping

As your stylesheets grow, it’s important to keep your CSS clean and efficient.
In this section, you’ll learn some useful shortcuts, grouping
techniques, and syntax patterns that will save time and reduce
repetition.

### Grouping Selectors

If multiple elements should share the same style, you don’t have to repeat
yourself.

Instead of writing:

```css
h1 {
  color: navy;
}
h2 {
  color: navy;
}
```

You can group them together:

```css
h1, h2 {
  color: navy;
}
```

Notice the comma in the selector. This allows the same properties to be applied
to the given selectors.

This makes your code shorter, easier to scan, and easier to update later.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use commas to group multiple selectors. Just be sure there’s no comma after
> the last one.

### Shorthand Properties

Some CSS properties support shorthand notation. This means you can set multiple
related values in one line.

#### Borders

You can define all aspects of a border in one line:

```css
p {
  border: 1px solid black;
}
```

That sets:

* Width: `1px`
* Style: `solid`
* Color: `black`

### Comments in CSS

Use comments to explain sections of your code or leave notes for yourself:

```css
/* This styles the main article section */
.article {
  padding: 20px;
}
```

Comments do not appear on the page and are ignored by the browser. You treat
the CSS comment indicators just like an open and closing tag. To open a comment
use `/*` and to close the comment use `*/`.

### Keeping Code Organized

* Group similar styles together (e.g. all headings in one block)
* Use indentation and spacing consistently
* Leave comments to mark different layout regions or purposes
* Don’t repeat the same property for the same elements unless necessary
