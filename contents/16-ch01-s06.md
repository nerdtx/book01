## Section 6: Where We See Hex

By now, you’ve seen how hexadecimal is just another way to write
numbers—specifically numbers that computers like to use. But hex isn’t just
something that shows up in textbooks or programming puzzles.

You’ll find it **all over the place** in real-world computing, especially in web
development, networking, and debugging. Let’s take a look at some common
examples.

### 1. Hex in Web Colors

In web design, colors are almost always written in hexadecimal. A six-digit hex
code represents the **Red, Green, and Blue (RGB)** components of a color:

* `#FF0000` → full red
* `#00FF00` → full green
* `#0000FF` → full blue
* `#FFFFFF` → white
* `#000000` → black

Each color component (R, G, B) is represented by **two hex digits**, ranging
from `00` (0 in decimal) to `FF` (255 in decimal).

Put another way, there are 3 components representing a color and they are all
some value of strength, or intensity, of that color component. If the Red is
stronger than the Blue or Green, the color will be more Red.  If the 3
components are all 255, the color is white. If the three components are all 0,
the color is black.  If the 3 components are equal (or close to equal), the
color will be some form of gray.

#### Example:

`#3A7FBF`

| Component | Hex | Decimal |
| --------- | --- | ------- |
| Red       | 3A  | 58      |
| Green     | 7F  | 127     |
| Blue      | BF  | 191     |

This notation gives designers precise control over color while keeping things
compact and readable.

### 2. Hex in Memory Addresses

When a computer runs a program, all the data it uses - your variables, images,
files, and instructions - is stored in memory. The **locations** in memory are
labeled using hexadecimal because it’s concise and easy to align with the
underlying binary data.

You’ll often see memory locations written like this:

* `0x0040A7F0`
* `0x7FFFDEAD`
* `0x000000FF`

These are not arbitrary—they’re used by debuggers, operating systems, and
programmers to manage data and execution.

We won't go into memory addressing in this class, but in later textbooks we'll
dive deep on that topic.

### 3. Hex in MAC Addresses

A **MAC address** is a unique identifier assigned to a network device (like your
Wi-Fi card).  This is most typically represented in hexadecimal.

Example MAC address:

```
8C:85:90:FA:1E:B2
```

Each pair of characters (like `8C`) represents one byte of information. These
are important when diagnosing networks or configuring routers.

### 4. Hex in Character Codes and Encoding

Hex is also used to represent characters and symbols in programming. For
example:

* The character `A` is `0x41`
* A space is `0x20`
* The Unicode code point for the smile emoji is `U+1F604`

Programmers often use hex to read or encode raw text data, especially when
dealing with escape sequences (`\x41` for `A`).


### Quick Reference – Where We See Hex

| Use Case            | Example                      | Description                                                              |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Web Colors**         | `#FF5733`, `#000000`, `#3A7FBF` | Represents Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) values in 2-digit hex each            |
| **Memory Addresses**   | `0x0040A7F0`, `0x7FFFDEAD`      | Labels for memory locations in programs and debuggers                       |
| **MAC Addresses**      | `8C:85:90:FA:1E:B2`             | 6-byte hardware identifier used in networking                               |
| **Character Codes**    | `'A' = 0x41`, `' ' = 0x20`      | ASCII and Unicode values for characters and symbols                         |
| **Escape Sequences**   | `\x41`                          | Used in programming to represent characters by their hex code               |
| **Color Manipulation** | `#00FF00 → RGB(0, 255, 0)`      | Easily split hex colors into RGB decimal values for animations/interactions |


### Summary

Hexadecimal isn’t a “computer-only” format—it’s a practical, efficient way for
humans and machines to talk about data. Once you get used to reading hex, you’ll
start recognizing patterns in everything from color codes to low-level
diagnostics.

> Any time computers need to be *precise* but *readable*, they reach for hex.
