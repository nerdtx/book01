## Section 2: The Role of the `<div>` Element

The `<div>` tag is short for “division,” and that’s exactly what it does—it divides your page into sections. It’s one of the most important layout tools in HTML.

Unlike headings or paragraphs, the `<div>` element doesn’t have a specific visual meaning by itself. It doesn’t add a title, text, or image. It’s a **generic container** used to group other elements together.

### What Is a `<div>`?

Here’s a basic example:

```html
<div>
  <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
  <p>I enjoy hiking, photography, and coding small projects in JavaScript.</p>
</div>
```

The `<div>` here is wrapping a heading and a paragraph. You won’t see anything different on the page—unless you add styling later—but this invisible container helps keep related content organized.

### Why Use a `<div>`?

The `<div>` tag is useful because it:

* Groups related content together
* Helps structure a page for readability and future styling
* Makes it easier to select and style regions using CSS
* Provides a target for behavior in JavaScript

Without it, your page becomes difficult to manage as it grows.

### Divs as Building Blocks

You can think of a webpage as a set of **stacked boxes**. Each box contains part of your content:

* One div for the header
* One for the main content
* One for a sidebar
* One for the footer

```html
<div id="header">
  <h1>My Website</h1>
</div>

<div id="content">
  <p>Welcome to my page!</p>
</div>

<div id="footer">
  <p>Contact me at email@example.com</p>
</div>
```

This is a basic layout skeleton made entirely of divs.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Even if you don’t apply any styles yet, using divs early will help you stay organized and prepare your code for future improvements.

In the next section, you’ll practice wrapping and nesting content using `<div>` elements. This is where your pages start to gain real structure.
