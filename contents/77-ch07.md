## Section 7: Getting Input with `prompt()`

Up to now, JavaScript has been doing all the talking — printing messages to the
console or displaying simple output. But interactive programs **need input**
from the user in order to be useful.

That’s where the `prompt()` function comes in.

### What is `prompt()`?

The `prompt()` function shows a small popup window asking the user to type
something. The value they enter is returned as a string and can be stored in a
variable.

Example:

```js
let name = prompt("What is your name?");
console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
```

When this code runs, a box will appear in the browser asking the user for their
name. Whatever they type will be stored in the `name` variable, and then printed
to the console with a greeting.

### A Few Things to Know

* `prompt()` **always returns a string**, even if the user types a number.
* You can try to that string to a number using `Number()` or `parseInt()` if
  needed.

Example:

```js
let age = prompt("How old are you?");
let ageNumber = Number(age);
console.log("Next year, you'll be " + (ageNumber + 1));
```

If the user types “15”, JavaScript will convert it to the number `15`, and the
result will be “Next year, you’ll be 16.”

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If the user presses "Cancel" instead of entering a value, `prompt()` returns
> `null`. Be prepared for that possibility in real applications.

### Using `prompt()` in Simple Programs

You can use `prompt()` to make basic interactive tools:

```js
let favoriteColor = prompt("What's your favorite color?");
console.log("Nice choice! " + favoriteColor + " is a great color.");
```
