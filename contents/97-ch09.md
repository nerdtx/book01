## Section 7: Looping Through Objects

In earlier sections, you learned how to loop through arrays using `for` loops
and `for...of`. But what about objects? Objects don’t use numeric indexes —
they use keys — so we need a different approach to loop through them.

JavaScript provides several methods to loop over an object's keys and values.

### Using `for...in` to Loop Over Keys

The `for...in` loop lets you loop through all the **keys** in an object:

```js
let book = {
  title: "The Hobbit",
  author: "J.R.R. Tolkien",
  year: 1937
};

for (let key in book) {
  console.log(key);           // prints the key
  console.log(book[key]);     // prints the value
}
```

This loop visits every key (`"title"`, `"author"`, `"year"`) and lets you use
bracket notation to access each corresponding value.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use `for...in` when you want to loop over all keys in an object — but always
> use bracket notation to access the value inside the loop.

### Getting an Array of Keys or Values

You can also convert an object into an **array of keys** or **array of values**:

```js
let keys = Object.keys(book);
let values = Object.values(book);

console.log(keys);   // ["title", "author", "year"]
console.log(values); // ["The Hobbit", "J.R.R. Tolkien", 1937]
```

You can then use regular `for` loops or `forEach()` on those arrays:

```js
for(let k of keys) {
  console.log(`${k}: ${book[k]}`);
}
```

### Getting Both Keys and Values with `Object.entries()`

If you want *both the key and value* at once, use `Object.entries()`:

```js
let entries = Object.entries(book);

for (let [key, value] of entries) {
  console.log(`${key} → ${value}`);
}
```

This technique uses **array destructuring** to pull apart the key-value pair on
each loop.

Notice this creates both a `key` and `value` variable for each iteration of the
`for` loop and is quite powerful.

### Summary

| Loop Type          | Use Case                          |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| `for...in`         | Loop over all keys in an object   |
| `Object.keys()`    | Get an array of keys              |
| `Object.values()`  | Get an array of values            |
| `Object.entries()` | Get both keys and values as pairs |

Looping through objects gives you full access to their structure and contents —
which is critical when working with things like form data, configurations, or
JSON from APIs.
