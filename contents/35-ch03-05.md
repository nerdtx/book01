## Section 5: HTML in Practice - Writing and Testing

Now that you’ve seen the basic HTML tags, it’s time to put them into action.
This section walks you through how to create, save, and test your first HTML
files using a simple text editor and your web browser.

You don’t need any fancy tools or special software to write HTML. All you need
is a text editor and a modern browser.

### Step 1: Choose a Text Editor

While you could use something basic like Notepad or TextEdit, it’s better to
choose a _code-friendly editor_ that understands HTML.

Recommended editors:

* **CodeEdit** (Mac only, in active dev but quite useable and simple)
* **Visual Studio Code** (Windows/Mac/Linux, full featured... TOO full featured)
* **Sublime Text** (Mac/Windows/Linux, free to try)
* **Notepad++** (Windows only)

These editors offer syntax highlighting, auto-complete, and useful extensions
to make your work easier.

### Step 2: Create an HTML File

Open your text editor and type the following:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
    <p>This is my first webpage.</p>
  </body>
</html>
```

Then save the file with the name `index.html`. Make sure it ends with `.html`
(not `.txt` or anything else).

### Step 3: Open the File in Your Browser

Find the file on your computer and double-click it. Your browser will open it
like a normal website.

You should see:

* A bold heading that says “Hello, world!”
* A paragraph underneath that says “This is my first webpage.”

If so, congratulations - you just built and viewed your first web page.

### Step 4: Make Changes and Refresh

Now try editing the file:

* Change the heading
* Add more paragraphs
* Insert an image or a link

Save the file, then _refresh the browser_ to see the changes. This feedback
loop - edit, save, refresh - is how most frontend development begins.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Your browser doesn’t need the internet to read a local `.html` file. It just
> needs a well-formed document and access to the file on your computer.
