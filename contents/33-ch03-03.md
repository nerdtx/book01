## Section 3: The Basic Document Structure

Every HTML page begins with a specific structure that tells the browser:

“This is a real web page—here’s what to expect.”

In this section, you'll learn how to build the foundation of every HTML
document. Once this structure is in place, you can add content, style it, and
be on your way to creating content and applications.

### The Doctype Declaration

At the very top of every HTML file, you should include the **doctype
declaration**:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

This line isn’t a tag - it’s an instruction to the browser that this document
uses modern HTML5. Without it, browsers might enter "quirks mode" (yes this is a
real thing, and you want to avoid it) and behave unpredictably.

### The Required Tags

All HTML documents must contain the following elements to be considered fully
formed:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>My First Web Page</title>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

Let’s break that down.

---

### `<html>`

This is the **root element**, which contains all other elements. It defines the
boundaries of your HTML document.

---

### `<head>`

This section contains **meta-information** about the document - information the
browser uses but that the user doesn’t usually see. Common tags inside the head
include:

* `<title>` – Sets the name of the tab or window
* `<meta charset="utf-8">` – Sets the character encoding
* `<link>` – Loads CSS stylesheets
* `<script>` – Loads external JavaScript

---

### `<body>`

This is where all visible content goes which is contained within the
**viewport**: text, images, headings, links, buttons, and more. If it’s meant to
appear on the screen, it belongs in the body.

---

### Why Structure Matters

Web browsers process HTML from top to bottom. If your structure is broken or
incomplete, parts of your page might not render correctly or at all.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> If your page isn’t working as expected, always check that your tags are
> properly nested and that you’ve included the basic document structure.
