## Section 5: Introduction to Objects

So far, you've worked with *arrays*, which are great for holding ordered
lists. But what if you want to *name* the values you're storing? That’s where
*objects* come in.

JavaScript **objects** let you store data in **key-value pairs**, where each
**key** is a label and each **value** is some piece of information.

### Real-World Analogy

Think of an object like a *dictionary entry*:

* The word is the **key**
* The definition is the **value**

Or imagine a *contact card*:

* `"name"`: `"Taylor"`
* `"email"`: `"taylor@example.com"`
* `"age"`: `16`

You can store all this info together in one object.

### Creating an Object

Here’s how to define a basic object:

```js
let user = {
  name: "Taylor",
  age: 16,
  email: "taylor@example.com"
};
```

The keys (`name`, `age`, `email`) are also called **properties**.

### Accessing Object Data

You can access values using **dot notation** which is a dot then the name of the
value:

```js
console.log(user.name); // "Taylor"
console.log(user.age);  // 16
```

Or you can use **bracket notation** which uses square brackets like with an
array, but the index is the key instead of a number:

```js
console.log(user["email"]); // "taylor@example.com"
```

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Use dot notation when you know the exact property name. Use brackets when
> you're working with dynamic or variable-based keys.

### Adding or Changing Properties

You can **add** new properties or **update** existing ones like this:

```js
user.grade = 11;
user.age = 17;
```

Now the object looks like:

```js
{
  name: "Taylor",
  age: 17,
  email: "taylor@example.com",
  grade: 11
}
```

### Summary

| Action          | Syntax Example             |
| --------------- | -------------------------- |
| Create object   | `let obj = { key: value }` |
| Read property   | `obj.key` or `obj["key"]`  |
| Add property    | `obj.newKey = value`       |
| Update property | `obj.key = newValue`       |

Objects are everywhere in JavaScript — you'll see them in API responses, in
configurations, in browser tools, and in nearly every real-world app. In the
next section, we’ll dive deeper into *how to access and modify object data*.
