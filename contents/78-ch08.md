### **Section 8: Mini Project - Getting to Know You**

In this assignment, you’ll build a simple interactive web page that uses
`prompt()` to ask the user a series of questions. Based on their answers, your
script will print a short introduction in the browser console.

#### **Instructions**

1. Create a new `.html` file.
2. Inside a `<script>` tag, write JavaScript code that:
   * Asks the user for their **first name**
   * Asks for their **favorite color**
   * Asks what **city** they live in
3. Store each answer in a variable.
4. Use **template literals** to combine their answers into a sentence like:

```plaintext
Hello, Jeremy! It's cool that your favorite color is blue. I've heard great
things about Austin.
```

5. Print the message to the **console**.

#### **Bonus Challenges**

* Ask how old the user is, and calculate what year they were born in.
* Use `alert()` to show the final message in a popup instead of just the
  console.

> **Helpful Hint:**
> Don’t forget that `prompt()` always returns a string. If you need a number,
> wrap the prompt in `Number()` — like `Number(prompt("How old are you?"))`.
